A man like Sherlock Holmes has many enemies.  Violent murderers, deviant villains, ghosts of old loves, blackmailers and poisonous scribes, to to name but a few.  But none are so deadly, so powerful, as Professor Moriarty.  Moriarty - the only man who can compete with Holmes' genius.  The only man who can, perhaps, ultimately defeat the great detective ..." />

The Doyles were an artistic family, the most successful being Arthur’s uncle ‘Dickie’ Doyle, the noted illustrator for </span><em id="em_000004" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#em_000004">Punch,</em><span class="text" id="span_000001" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000001"> but his father suffered from alcoholism and later epilepsy, and was eventually committed to a mental hospital. Conan Doyle maintained a distant relationship with him, but it was his mother, whom he affectionately referred to as ‘the Ma’am’, who encouraged his love of literature, and he remained close to her throughout his life. The young Arthur was educated at the northern Jesuit school Stonyhurst, going on to study medicine at Edinburgh and was an enthusiastic reader and storyteller from a young age, as well as being an active sportsman. </span></p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000013" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000013">Conan Doyle incurred the wrath of his rich relations when he announced he was an agnostic. Rejecting their strict Catholicism and cut off from their patronage, he decided to set up his own practice in Southsea in 1882. There he met his first wife, Louise Hawkins or ‘Touie’, and the couple were married in 1885, later having two children, a son and a daughter. But in 1897 Conan Doyle met and instantly fell in love with Jean Leckie. They maintained a platonic relationship for ten years and Conan Doyle struggled with his feelings of guilt and deep affection for his wife and his passion for Jean. When in 1906 Touie died of consumption, Conan Doyle genuinely mourned her. He finally married Jean in 1907 and they had two sons and a daughter, living very happily together on their estate in Sussex, Windlesham, until Conan Doyle’s death in 1930. </p>
        <p id="abouttheauthor-pii" xml:space="preserve"><span class="text" id="span_000002" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000002">It was in the year after his first marriage that Conan Doyle began toying with a character called Sherrinford Holmes. This was to become the first Sherlock Holmes story, his ‘shilling shocker’, </span><em id="em_000005" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#em_000005">A Study in</em><span class="text" id="span_000003" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000003"> Scarlet, published in 1887. And so the celebrated detective was born, with the faithful Dr Watson at his side. Conan Doyle consistently gave credit for the character to Dr Joseph Bell, an old tutor of his from Edinburgh University whose precision and powers of deduction Conan Doyle greatly admired. On the origins of the name, he commented that ‘I made thirty runs [at cricket] against a bowler by the name of Sherlock, and I always had a kindly feeling for the name’. </span></p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000014"><span class="text" id="span_000004" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000004">But it was in the new, popular literary magazine the </span><em id="em_000006" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#em_000006">Strand</em><span class="text" id="span_000005" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000005"> that the phenomenon of Sherlock Holmes really took off, with ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’ appearing in 1891. It was an instant hit. Sidney Paget created the distinctive illustrations of Holmes, based on his younger brother Walter, depicted in a deerstalker (the pipe would come later). This iconic image became etched in the public’s mind and was more glamorous than Conan Doyle had envisaged: ‘the handsome Walter took the place of the more powerful, but uglier, Sherlock, and perhaps from the point of view of my lady readers it was as well.’ </span></p>
        <p id="abouttheauthor-piii" xml:space="preserve"><span class="text" id="span_000006" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#span_000006">By this time Conan Doyle had given up practising medicine entirely to write. He yearned to concentrate on his historical novels and, despite his success, saw Holmes as ‘taking his mind from better things’. So, after only two years, in 1893 he decided to kill him off in ‘The Final Problem’, where Holmes famously met his end alongside his nemesis Professor Moriarty.

By the beginning of the twentieth century the fan base for Sherlock Holmes was massive and far-reaching, from a Boston cabby in America to Abdul Hamid II, the then Sultan of Turkey, and has continued growing to this day. There have been countless stage productions and films, with Holmes defined by such actors as Basil Rathbone, Jeremy Brett and Michael Caine. And the stories weren’t merely entertainment; the investigative methods Conan Doyle used are said to have had a huge influence on police processes at the time. </span></p>

Indeed, my only wonder was that he had not already been mixed up in this extraordinary case, which was the one topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For a whole day my companion had rambled about the room with his chin upon his chest and his brows knitted, charging and recharging his pipe with the strongest black tobacco, and absolutely deaf to any of my questions or remarks. Fresh editions of every paper had been sent up by our newsagent only to be glanced over and tossed down into a corner. Yet, silent as he was, I knew perfectly well what it was over which he was brooding. There was but one problem before the public which could challenge his powers of analysis, and that was the singular disappearance of the favourite for the Wessex Cup, and the tragic murder of its trainer. When, therefore, he suddenly announced his intention of setting out for the scene of the drama, it was only what I had both expected and hoped for. </p>

And I think that your time will not be misspent, for there are points about this case which promise to make it an absolutely unique one. We have, I think, just time to catch our train at Paddington, and I will go further into the matter upon our journey. You would oblige me by bringing with you your very excellent field-glass.’ </p>

The tragedy has been so uncommon, so complete, and of such personal importance to so many people that we are suffering from a plethora of surmise, conjecture, and hypothesis. The difficulty is to detach the framework of fact – of absolute, undeniable fact – from the embellishments of theorists and reporters. Then, having established ourselves upon this sound basis, it is our duty to see what inferences may be drawn, and which are the special points upon which the whole mystery turns. On Tuesday evening I received telegrams, both from Colonel Ross, the owner of the horse, and from Inspector Gregory, who is looking after the case, inviting my co-operation.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000040" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000040">‘Tuesday evening!’ I exclaimed. ‘And this is Thursday morning. Why did you not go down yesterday?’</p>

The fact is that I could not believe it possible that the most remarkable horse in England could long remain concealed, especially in so sparsely inhabited a place as the north of Dartmoor. From hour to hour yesterday I expected to hear that he had been found, and that his abductor was the murderer of John Straker. When, however, another morning had come and I found that, beyond the arrest of young Fitzroy Simpson, nothing had been done, I felt that it was time for me to take action. Yet in some ways I feel that yesterday has not been wasted.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000042" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000042">‘You have formed a theory, then?’</p>

I shall enumerate them to you, for nothing clears up a case so much as stating it to another person, and I can hardly expect your co-operation if I do not show you the position from which we start.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p4" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p4">I lay back against the cushions, puffing at my cigar, while Holmes, leaning forward, with his long thin forefinger checking off the points upon the palm of his left hand, gave me a sketch of the events which had led to our journey. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000044" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000044">‘Silver Blaze’, said he, ‘is from the Isonomy stock, and holds as brilliant a record as his famous ancestor. He is now in his fifth year, and has brought in turn each of the prizes of the turf to Colonel Ross, his fortunate owner. Up to the time of the catastrophe he was first favourite for the Wessex Cup, the betting being three to one on. He has always, however, been a prime favourite with the racing public, and has never yet disappointed them, so that even at short odds enormous sums of money have been laid upon him. It is obvious, therefore, that there were many people who had the strongest interest in preventing Silver Blaze from being there at the fall of the flag next Tuesday. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p5" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p5">‘This fact was, of course, appreciated at King’s Pyland, where the colonel’s training stable is situated. Every precaution was taken to guard the favourite. The trainer, John Straker, was a retired jockey, who rode in Colonel Ross’s colours before he became too heavy for the weighing chair. He had served the colonel for five years as jockey, and for seven as trainer, and had always shown himself to be a zealous and honest servant. Under him were three lads, for the establishment was a small one, containing only four horses in all. One of these lads sat up each night in the stable, while the others slept in the loft. All three bore excellent characters. John Straker, who was a married man, lived in a small villa about two hundred yards from the stables. He had no children, kept one maidservant, and was comfortably off. The country round is very lonely, but about half a mile to the north there is a small cluster of villas which have been built by a Tavistock contractor for the use of invalids and others who may wish to enjoy the pure Dartmoor air. Tavistock itself lies two miles to the west, while across the moor, also about two miles distant, is the larger training establishment of Capleton, which belongs to Lord Blackwater, and is managed by Silas Brown. In every other direction the moor is a complete wilderness, inhabited only by a few roaming gypsies. Such was the general situation last Monday night, when the catastrophe occurred. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000045" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000045">‘On that evening the horses had been exercised and watered as usual, and the stables were locked up at nine o’clock. Two of the lads walked up to the trainer’s house, where they had supper in the kitchen, while the third, Ned Hunter, remained on guard. At a few minutes after nine the maid, Edith Baxter, carried down to the stables his supper, which consisted of a dish of curried mutton. She took no liquid, as there was a water-tap in the stables, and it was the rule that the lad on duty should drink nothing else. The maid carried a lantern with her, as it was very dark, and the path ran across the open moor. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000046" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000046">‘Edith Baxter was within thirty yards of the stables when a man appeared out of the darkness and called to her to stop. As he stepped into the circle of yellow light thrown by the lantern she saw that he was a person of gentlemanly bearing, dressed in a grey suit of tweed with a cloth cap. He wore gaiters, and carried a heavy stick with a knob to it. She was most impressed, however, by the extreme pallor of his face and by the nervousness of his manner. His age, she thought, would be rather over thirty than under it. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000047" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000047">‘“Can you tell me where I am?” he asked. “I had almost made up my mind to sleep on the moor, when I saw the light of your lantern.” </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p6" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p6">‘“You are close to the King’s Pyland training stables,” she said. </p>

What a stroke of luck!” he cried. “I understand that a stable boy sleeps there alone every night. Perhaps that is his supper which you are carrying to him. Now I am sure that you would not be too proud to earn the price of a new dress, would you?” He took a piece of white paper folded up out of his waistcoat pocket. “See that the boy has this tonight, and you shall have the prettiest frock that money can buy.” </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000049" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000049">‘She was frightened by the earnestness of his manner, and ran past him to the window through which she was accustomed to hand the meals. It was already open, and Hunter was seated at the small table inside. She had begun to tell him of what had happened, when the stranger came up again. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000050" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000050">‘“Good evening,” said he, looking through the window, “I wanted to have a word with you.” The girl has sworn that as he spoke she noticed the corner of the little paper packet protruding from his closed hand. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000051" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000051">‘“What business have you here?” asked the lad.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000052" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000052">‘“It’s business that may put something into your pocket,” said the other. “You’ve two horses in for the Wessex Cup – Silver Blaze and Bayard. Let me have the straight tip, and you won’t be a loser. Is it a fact that at the weights Bayard could give the other a hundred yards in five furlongs, and that the stable have put their money on him?” </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p7" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p7">‘“So you’re one of those damned touts,” cried the lad. “I’ll show you how we serve them in King’s Pyland.” He sprang up and rushed across the stable to unloose the dog. The girl fled away to the house, but as she ran she looked back, and saw that the stranger was leaning through the window. A minute later, however, when Hunter rushed out with the hound he was gone, and though the lad ran all round the buildings he failed to find any trace of him.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000053" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000053">‘One moment!’ I asked. ‘Did the stable boy, when he ran out with the dog, leave the door unlocked behind him?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000054" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000054">‘Excellent, Watson; excellent!’ murmured my companion. ‘The importance of the point struck me so forcibly that I sent a special wire to Dartmoor yesterday to clear the matter up. The boy locked the door before he left it. The window, I may add, was not large enough for a man to go through. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000055" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000055">‘Hunter waited until his fellow grooms had returned, when he sent a message up to the trainer and told him what had occurred. Straker was excited at hearing the account, although he does not seem to have quite realised its true significance. It left him, however, vaguely uneasy, and Mrs Straker, waking at one in the morning, found that he was dressing. In reply to her enquiries, he said that he could not sleep on account of his anxiety about the horses, and that he intended to walk down to the stables to see that all was well. She begged him to remain at home, as she could hear the rain pattering against the windows, but in spite of her entreaties he pulled on his large macintosh and left the house. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000056" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000056">‘Mrs Straker awoke at seven in the morning, to find that her husband had not yet returned. She dressed herself hastily, called the maid, and set off for the stables. The door was open; inside, huddled together upon a chair, Hunter was sunk in a state of absolute stupor, the favourite’s stall was empty, and there were no signs of his trainer. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p8" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p8">‘The two lads who slept in the chaff-cutting loft above the harness-room were quickly roused. They had heard nothing during the night, for they are both sound sleepers. Hunter was obviously under the influence of some powerful drug; and, as no sense could be got out of him, he was left to sleep it off while the two lads and the two women ran out in search of the absentees. They still had hopes that the trainer had for some reason taken out the horse for early exercise, but on ascending the knoll near the house, from which all the neighbouring moors were visible, not only could they see no signs of the favourite, but they perceived something which warned them that they were in the presence of a tragedy. </p>

Immediately beyond there was a bowl-shaped depression in the moor, and at the bottom of this was found the dead body of the unfortunate trainer. His head had been shattered by a savage blow from some heavy weapon, and he was wounded in the thigh, where there was a long, clean cut, inflicted evidently by some very sharp instrument. It was clear, however, that Straker had defended himself vigorously against his assailants, for in his right hand he held a small knife, which was clotted with blood up to the handle, while in his left he grasped a red and black silk cravat, which was recognised by the maid as having been worn on the preceding evening by the stranger who had visited the stables. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000058" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000058">‘Hunter, on recovering from his stupor, was also quite positive as to the ownership of the cravat. He was equally certain that the same stranger had, while standing at the window, drugged his curried mutton, and so deprived the stables of their watchman. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p9" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p9">‘As to the missing horse, there were abundant proofs in the mud which lay at the bottom of the fatal hollow that he had been there at the time of the struggle. But from that morning he has disappeared; and although a large reward has been offered, and all the gypsies of Dartmoor are on the alert, no news has come of him. Finally an analysis has shown that the remains of his supper, left by the stable lad, contain an appreciable quantity of powdered opium, while the people of the house partook of the same dish on the same night without any ill-effect. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000059" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000059">‘Those are the main facts of the case stripped of all surmise and stated as baldly as possible. I shall now recapitulate what the police have done in the matter. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000060" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000060">‘Inspector Gregory, to whom the case has been committed, is an extremely competent officer. Were he but gifted with imagination he might rise to great heights in his profession. On his arrival he promptly found and arrested the man upon whom suspicion naturally rested. There was little difficulty in finding him, for he was thoroughly well known in the neighbourhood. His name, it appears, was Fitzroy Simpson. He was a man of excellent birth and education, who had squandered a fortune upon the turf, and lived now by doing a little quiet and genteel bookmaking in the sporting clubs of London. An examination of his betting-book shows that bets to the amount of five thousand pounds had been registered by him against the favourite. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p10" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p10">‘On being arrested he volunteered the statement that he had come down to Dartmoor in the hope of getting some information about the King’s Pyland horses, and also about Desborough, the second favourite, which was in the charge of Silas Brown, at the Capleton stables. He did not attempt to deny that he had acted as described upon the evening before, but declared that he had no sinister designs, and had simply wished to obtain first-hand information. When confronted with the cravat he turned very pale, and was utterly unable to account for its presence in the hand of the murdered man. His wet clothing showed that he had been out in the storm of the night before, and his stick, which was a Penang lawyer, weighted with lead, was just such a weapon as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to which the trainer had succumbed. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000061" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000061">‘On the other hand, there was no wound upon his person, while the state of Straker’s knife would show that one, at least, of his assailants must bear his mark upon him. There you have it all in a nutshell, Watson, and if you can give me any light I shall be infinitely obliged to you.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000062" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000062">I had listened with the greatest interest to the statement which Holmes, with characteristic clearness, had laid before me. Though most of the facts were familiar to me, I had not sufficiently appreciated their relative importance, nor their connection with each other. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000063" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000063">‘Is it not possible’, I suggested, ‘that the incised wound upon Straker may have been caused by his own knife in the convulsive struggles which follow any brain injury?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000064" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000064">‘It is more than possible; it is probable,’ said Holmes. ‘In that case, one of the main points in favour of the accused disappears.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000065" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000065">‘And yet,’ said I, ‘even now I fail to understand what the theory of the police can be.’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p11" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p11">‘I am afraid that whatever theory we state has very grave objections to it,’ returned my companion. ‘The police imagine, I take it, that this Fitzroy Simpson, having drugged the lad, and having in some way obtained a duplicate key, opened the stable door, and took out the horse, with the intention, apparently, of kidnapping him altogether. His bridle is missing, so that Simpson must have put it on. Then, having left the door open behind him, he was leading the horse away over the moor, when he was either met or overtaken by the trainer. A row naturally ensued, Simpson beat out the trainer’s brains with his heavy stick without receiving any injury from the small knife which Straker used in self-defence, and then either the thief led the horse on to some secret hiding-place, or else it may have bolted during the struggle, and be now wandering out on the moors. That is the case as it appears to the police, and improbable as it is, all other explanations are more improbable still. However, I shall very quickly test the matter when I am once upon the spot, and until then I really cannot see how we can get much further than our present position.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000066" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000066">It was evening before we reached the little town of Tavistock, which lies, like the boss of a shield, in the middle of the huge circle of Dartmoor. Two gentlemen were awaiting us at the station; the one a tall fair man with lionlike hair and beard, and curiously penetrating light blue eyes, the other a small alert person, very neat and dapper, in a frock-coat and gaiters, with trim little side-whiskers and an eyeglass. The latter was Colonel Ross, the well-known sportsman, the other Inspector Gregory, a man who was rapidly making his name in the English detective service. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000067" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000067">‘I am delighted that you have come down, Mr Holmes,’ said the colonel. ‘The inspector here has done all that could possibly be suggested; but I wish to leave no stone unturned in trying to avenge poor Straker, and in recovering my horse.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000068" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000068">‘Have there been any fresh developments?’ asked Holmes.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000069" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000069">‘I am sorry to say that we have made very little progress,’ said the inspector. ‘We have an open carriage outside, and as you would no doubt like to see the place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p12" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p12">A minute later we were all seated in a comfortable landau and were rattling through the quaint old Devonshire town. Inspector Gregory was full of his case, and poured out a stream of remarks, while Holmes threw in an occasional question or interjection. Colonel Ross leaned back with his arms folded and his hat tilted over his eyes, while I listened with interest to the dialogue of the two detectives. Gregory was formulating his theory, which was almost exactly what Holmes had foretold in the train. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000070" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000070">‘The net is drawn pretty close round Fitzroy Simpson,’ he remarked, ‘and I believe myself that he is our man. At the same time, I recognise that the evidence is purely circumstantial, and that some new development may upset it.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000071" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000071">‘How about Straker’s knife?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000072" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000072">‘We have quite come to the conclusion that he wounded himself in his fall.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000073" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000073">‘My friend Dr Watson made that suggestion to me as we came down. If so, it would tell against this man Simpson.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000074" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000074">‘Undoubtedly. He has neither a knife nor any sign of a wound. The evidence against him is certainly very strong. He had a great interest in the disappearance of the favourite, he lies under the suspicion of having poisoned the stable boy, he was undoubtedly out in the storm, he was armed with a heavy stick, and his cravat was found in the dead man’s hand. I really think we have enough to go before a jury.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p13" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p13">Holmes shook his head. ‘A clever counsel would tear it all to rags,’ said he. ‘Why should he take the horse out of the stable? If he wished to injure it, why could he not do it there? Has a duplicate key been found in his possession? What chemist sold him the powdered opium? Above all, where could he, a stranger to the district, hide a horse, and such a horse as this? What is his own explanation as to the paper which he wished the maid to give to the stable boy?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000075" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000075">‘He says that it was a ten-pound note. One was found in his purse. But your other difficulties are not so formidable as they seem. He is not a stranger to the district. He has twice lodged at Tavistock in the summer. The opium was probably brought from London. The key, having served its purpose, would be hurled away. The horse may lie at the bottom of one of the pits or old mines upon the moor.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000076" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000076">‘What does he say about the cravat?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000077" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000077">‘He acknowledges that it is his, and declares that he had lost it. But a new element has been introduced into the case which may account for his leading the horse from the stable.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000078" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000078">Holmes pricked up his ears.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000079" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000079">‘We have found traces which show that a party of gypsies encamped on Monday night within a mile of the spot where the murder took place. On Tuesday they were gone. Now, presuming that there was some understanding between Simpson and these gypsies, might he not have been leading the horse to them when he was overtaken, and may they not have him now?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000080" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000080">‘It is certainly possible.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000081" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000081">‘The moor is being scoured for these gypsies. I have also examined every stable and outhouse in Tavistock, and for a radius of ten miles.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000082" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000082">‘There is another training stable quite close, I understand?’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p14" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p14">‘Yes, and that is a factor which we must certainly not neglect. As Desborough, their horse, was second in the betting, they had an interest in the disappearance of the favourite. Silas Brown, the trainer, is known to have had large bets upon the event, and he was no friend to poor Straker. We have, however, examined the stables, and there is nothing to connect him with the affair.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000083" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000083">‘And nothing to connect this man Simpson with the interests of the Capleton stable?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000084" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000084">‘Nothing at all.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000085" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000085">Holmes leaned back in the carriage and the conversation ceased. A few minutes later our driver pulled up at a neat little red-brick villa with overhanging eaves, which stood by the road. Some distance off, across a paddock, lay a long grey-tiled outbuilding. In every other direction the low curves of the moor, bronze-coloured from the fading ferns, stretched away to the sky-line, broken only by the steeples of Tavistock, and by a cluster of houses away to the westward, which marked the Capleton stables. We all sprang out with the exception of Holmes, who continued to lean back with his eyes fixed upon the sky in front of him, entirely absorbed in his own thoughts. It was only when I touched his arm that he roused himself with a violent start and stepped out of the carriage. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000086" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000086">‘Excuse me,’ said he, turning to Colonel Ross, who had looked at him in some surprise. ‘I was day-dreaming.’ There was a gleam in his eyes and a suppressed excitement in his manner which convinced me, used as I was to his ways, that his hand was upon a clue, though I could not imagine where he had found it. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000087" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000087">‘Perhaps you would prefer at once to go on to the scene of the crime, Mr Holmes?’ said Gregory.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000088" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000088">‘I think that I should prefer to stay here a little and go into one or two questions of detail. Straker was brought back here, I presume?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000089" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000089">‘Yes, he lies upstairs. The inquest is tomorrow.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000090" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000090">‘He has been in your service some years, Colonel Ross?’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p15" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p15">‘I have always found him an excellent servant.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000091" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000091">‘I presume that you made an inventory of what he had in his pockets at the time of his death, Inspector?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000092" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000092">‘I have the things themselves in the sitting-room if you would care to see them.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000093" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000093">‘I should be very glad.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000094" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000094">We all filed into the front room and sat round the central table, while the inspector unlocked a square tin box and laid a small heap of things before us. There was a box of vestas, two inches of tallow candle, an A.D.P. briar-root pipe, a pouch of sealskin with half an ounce of long-cut Cavendish, a silver watch with a gold chain, five sovereigns in gold, an aluminium pencil-case, a few papers, and an ivory-handled knife with a very delicate inflexible blade marked ‘Weiss and Co., London’. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000095" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000095">‘This is a very singular knife,’ said Holmes, lifting it up and examining it minutely. ‘I presume, as I see bloodstains upon it, that it is the one which was found in the dead man’s grasp. Watson, this knife is surely in your line.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000096" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000096">‘It is what we call a cataract knife,’ said I.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000097" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000097">‘I thought so. A very delicate blade devised for very delicate work. A strange thing for a man to carry with him upon a rough expedition, especially as it would not shut in his pocket.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000098" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000098">‘The tip was guarded by a disc of cork which we found beside his body,’ said the inspector. ‘His wife tells us that the knife had lain for some days upon the dressing-table, and that he had picked it up as he left the room. It was a poor weapon, but perhaps the best that he could lay his hand on at the moment.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000099" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000099">‘Very possibly. How about these papers?’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p16" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p16">‘Three of them are receipted hay-dealers’ accounts. One of them is a letter of instructions from Colonel Ross. This other is a milliner’s account for thirty-seven pounds fifteen, made out by Madame Lesurier, of Bond Street, to William Darbyshire. Mrs Straker tells us that Darbyshire was a friend of her husband’s, and that occasionally his letters were addressed here.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000100" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000100">‘Madame Darbyshire has somewhat expensive tastes,’ remarked Holmes, glancing down the account. ‘Twenty-two guineas is rather heavy for a single costume. However, there appears to be nothing more to learn, and we may now go down to the scene of the crime.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000101" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000101">As we emerged from the sitting-room a woman who had been waiting in the passage took a step forward and laid her hand upon the inspector’s sleeve. Her face was haggard, and thin, and eager; stamped with the print of a recent horror. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000102" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000102">‘Have you got them? Have you found them?’ she panted.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000103" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000103">‘No, Mrs Straker; but Mr Holmes, here, has come from London to help us, and we shall do all that is possible.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000104" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000104">‘Surely I met you in Plymouth, at a garden party, some little time ago, Mrs Straker,’ said Holmes.</p>

A short walk across the moor took us to the hollow in which the body had been found. At the brink of it was the furze bush upon which the coat had been hung. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000109" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000109">‘There was no wind that night, I understand,’ said Holmes.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000121" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000121">‘It was invisible, buried in the mud. I only saw it because I was looking for it.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000123" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000123">‘I thought it not unlikely.’ He took the boots from the bag and compared the impressions of each of them with marks upon the ground. Then he clambered up to the rim of the hollow and crawled about among the ferns and bushes. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p18" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p18">‘I am afraid that there are no more tracks,’ said the inspector. ‘I have examined the ground very carefully for a hundred yards in each direction.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000124" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000124">‘Indeed!’ said Holmes, rising; ‘I should not have the impertinence to do it again after what you say. But I should like to take a little walk over the moors before it grows dark, that I may know my ground tomorrow, and I think that I shall put this horse-shoe into my pocket for luck.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000125" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000125">Colonel Ross, who had shown some signs of impatience at my companion’s quiet and systematic method of work, glanced at his watch. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000126" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000126">‘I wish you would come back with me, Inspector,’ said he. ‘There are several points on which I should like your advice, and especially as to whether we do not owe it to the public to remove our horse’s name from the entries for the Cup.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000127" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000127">‘Certainly not,’ cried Holmes, with decision; ‘I should let the name stand.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000128" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000128">The colonel bowed. ‘I am very glad to have had your opinion, sir,’ said he. ‘You will find us at poor Straker’s house when you have finished your walk, and we can drive together into Tavistock.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000129" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000129">He turned back with the inspector, while Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. The sun was beginning to sink behind the stables of Capleton, and the long sloping plain in front of us was tinged with gold, deepening into rich, ruddy brown where the faded ferns and brambles caught the evening light. But the glories of the landscape were all wasted upon my companion, who was sunk in the deepest thought. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p19" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p19">‘It’s this way, Watson,’ he said at last. ‘We may leave the question of who killed John Straker for the instant, and confine ourselves to finding out what has become of the horse. Now, supposing that he broke away during or after the tragedy, where could he have gone to? The horse is a very gregarious creature. If left to himself his instincts would have been either to return to King’s Pyland or go over to Capleton. Why should he run wild upon the moor? He would surely have been seen by now. And why should gypsies kidnap him? These people always clear out when they hear of trouble, for they do not wish to be pestered by the police. They could not hope to sell such a horse. They would run a great risk and gain nothing by taking him. Surely that is clear.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000130" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000130">‘Where is he, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000131" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000131">‘I have already said that he must have gone to King’s Pyland or Capleton. He is not at King’s Pyland, therefore he is at Capleton. Let us take that as a working hypothesis, and see what it leads us to. This part of the moor, as the inspector remarked, is very hard and dry. But it falls away towards Capleton, and you can see from here that there is a long hollow over yonder, which must have been very wet on Monday night. If our supposition is correct, then the horse must have crossed that, and there is the point where we should look for his tracks.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000132" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000132">We had been walking briskly during this conversation, and a few more minutes brought us to the hollow in question. At Holmes’s request I walked down the bank to the right, and he to the left, but I had not taken fifty paces before I heard him give a shout, and saw him waving his hand to me. The track of a horse was plainly outlined in the soft earth in front of him, and the shoe which he took from his pocket exactly fitted the impression. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000133" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000133">‘See the value of imagination,’ said Holmes. ‘It is the one quality which Gregory lacks. We imagined what might have happened, acted upon the supposition, and find ourselves justified. Let us proceed.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p20" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p20">We crossed the marshy bottom and passed over a quarter of a mile of dry, hard turf. Again the ground sloped and again we came on the tracks. Then we lost them for half a mile, but only to pick them up once more quite close to Capleton. It was Holmes who saw them first, and he stood pointing with a look of triumph upon his face. A man’s track was visible beside the horse’s. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000134" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000134">‘The horse was alone before,’ I cried.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000135" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000135">‘Quite so. It was alone before. Halloa! what is this?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000136" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000136">The double track turned sharp off and took the direction of King’s Pyland. Holmes whistled, and we both followed along after it. His eyes were on the trail, but I happened to look a little to one side, and saw to my surprise the same tracks coming back again in the opposite direction. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000137" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000137">‘One for you, Watson,’ said Holmes, when I pointed it out; ‘you have saved us a long walk which would have brought us back on our own traces. Let us follow the return track.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000138" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000138">We had not to go far. It ended at the paving of asphalt which led up to the gates of the Capleton stables. As we approached a groom ran out from them. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000139" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000139">‘We don’t want any loiterers about here,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000140" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000140">‘I only wish to ask a question,’ said Holmes, with his finger and thumb in his waistcoat pocket. ‘Should I be too early to see your master, Mr Silas Brown, if I were to call at five o’clock tomorrow morning?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000141" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000141">‘Bless you, sir, if anyone is about he will be, for he is always the first stirring. But here he is, sir, to answer your questions for himself. No, sir, no; it’s as much as my place is worth to let him see me touch your money. Afterwards, if you like.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p21" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p21">As Sherlock Holmes replaced the half-crown which he had drawn from his pocket, a fierce-looking elderly man strode out from the gate with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000142" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000142">‘What’s this, Dawson?’ he cried. ‘No gossiping! Go about your business! And you – what the devil do you want here?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000143" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000143">‘Ten minutes’ talk with you, my good sir,’ said Holmes, in the sweetest of voices.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000144" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000144">‘I’ve no time to talk to every gadabout. We want no strangers here. Be off, or you may find a dog at your heels.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000145" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000145">Holmes leaned forward and whispered something in the trainer’s ear. He started violently and flushed to the temples.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000146" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000146">‘It’s a lie!’ he shouted. ‘An infernal lie!’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000147" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000147">‘Very good! Shall we argue about it here in public, or talk it over in your parlour?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000148" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000148">‘Oh, come in if you wish to.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000149" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000149">Holmes smiled. ‘I shall not keep you more than a few minutes, Watson,’ he said. ‘Now, Mr Brown, I am quite at your disposal.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000150" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000150">It was quite twenty minutes, and the reds had all faded into greys before Holmes and the trainer reappeared. Never have I seen such a change as had been brought about in Silas Brown in that short time. His face was ashy pale, beads of perspiration shone upon his brow, and his hands shook until his hunting-crop wagged like a branch in the wind. His bullying, overbearing manner was all gone too, and he cringed along at my companion’s side like a dog with its master. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000151" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000151">‘Your instructions will be done. It shall be done,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000152" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000152">‘There must be no mistake,’ said Holmes, looking round at him. The other winced as he read the menace in his eyes.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000153" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000153">‘Oh, no, there shall be no mistake. It shall be there. Should I change it first or not?’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p22" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p22">Holmes thought a little and then burst out laughing. ‘No, don’t,’ said he. ‘I shall write to you about it. No tricks now or—’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000154" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000154">‘Oh, you can trust me, you can trust me!’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000158" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000158">‘A more perfect compound of the bully, coward, and sneak than Master Silas Brown I have seldom met with,’ remarked Holmes, as we trudged along together. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000159" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000159">‘He has the horse, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000160" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000160">‘He tried to bluster out of it, but I described to him so exactly what his actions had been upon that morning that he is convinced that I was watching him. Of course, you observed the peculiarly square toes in the impressions, and that his own boots exactly corresponded to them. Again, of course, no subordinate would have dared to have done such a thing. I described to him how when, according to his custom, he was the first down, he perceived a strange horse wandering over the moor; how he went out to it, and his astonishment at recognising from the white forehead which has given the favourite its name that chance had put in his power the only horse which could beat the one upon which he had put his money. Then I described how his first impulse had been to lead him back to King’s Pyland, and how the devil had shown him how he could hide the horse until the race was over, and how he had led it back and concealed it at Capleton. When I told him every detail he gave it up, and thought only of saving his own skin.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p23" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p23">‘But his stables had been searched.’ </p>

I don’t know whether you observed it, Watson, but the colonel’s manner has been just a trifle cavalier to me. I am inclined now to have a little amusement at his expense. Say nothing to him about the horse.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000166" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000166">‘Certainly not, without your permission.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000230" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000230">‘I confess’, said he, ‘that any theories which I had formed from the newspaper reports were entirely erroneous. And yet there were indications there, had they not been overlaid by other details which concealed their true import. I went to Devonshire with the conviction that Fitzroy Simpson was the true culprit, although, of course, I saw that the evidence against him was by no means complete. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000231" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000231">‘It was while I was in the carriage, just as we reached the trainer’s house, that the immense significance of the curried mutton occurred to me. You may remember that I was distrait, and remained sitting after you had all alighted. I was marvelling in my own mind how I could possibly have overlooked so obvious a clue.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000232" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000232">‘I confess’, said the colonel, ‘that even now I cannot see how it helps us.’</p>
        <p id="chapter002-p30" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p30">‘It was the first link in my chain of reasoning. Powdered opium is by no means tasteless. The flavour is not disagreeable, but it is perceptible. Were it mixed with any ordinary dish, the eater would undoubtedly detect it, and would probably eat no more. A curry was exactly the medium which would disguise this taste. By no possible supposition could this stranger, Fitzroy Simpson, have caused curry to be served in the trainer’s family that night, and it is surely too monstrous a coincidence to suppose that he happened to come along with powdered opium upon the very night when a dish happened to be served which would disguise the flavour. That is unthinkable. Therefore Simpson becomes eliminated from the case, and our attention centres upon Straker and his wife, the only two people who could have chosen curried mutton for supper that night. The opium was added after the dish was set aside for the stable boy, for the others had the same for supper with no ill-effects. Which of them, then, had access to that dish without the maid seeing them? </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000233" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000233">‘Before deciding that question I had grasped the significance of the silence of the dog, for one true inference invariably suggests others. The Simpson incident had shown me that a dog was kept in the stables, and yet, though someone had been in and had fetched out a horse, he had not barked enough to arouse the two lads in the loft. Obviously the midnight visitor was someone whom the dog knew well. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000234" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000234">‘I was already convinced, or almost convinced, that John Straker went down to the stables in the dead of the night and took out Silver Blaze. For what purpose? For a dishonest one, obviously, or why should he drug his own stable boy? And yet I was at a loss to know why. There have been cases before now where trainers have made sure of great sums of money by laying against their own horses, through agents, and then prevented them from winning by fraud. Sometimes it is a pulling jockey. Sometimes it is some surer and subtler means. What was it here? I hoped that the contents of his pockets might help me to form a conclusion. </p>
        <p id="chapter002-p31" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p31">‘And they did so. You cannot have forgotten the singular knife which was found in the dead man’s hand, a knife which certainly no sane man would choose for a weapon. It was, as DrWatson told us, a form of knife which is used for the most delicate operations known in surgery. And it was to be used for a delicate operation that night. You must know, with your wide experience of turf matters, Colonel Ross, that it is possible to make a slight nick upon the tendons of a horse’s ham, and to do it subcutaneously so as to leave absolutely no trace. A horse so treated would develop a slight lameness which would be put down to a strain in exercise or a touch of rheumatism, but never to foul play. </p>

        <p id="chapter002-p32" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter002-p32">‘Undoubtedly. But in examining his belongings, I was fortunate enough to discover, not only the method of the crime, but even its motives. As a man of the world, Colonel, you know that men do not carry other people’s bills about in their pockets. We have most of us quite enough to do to settle our own. I at once concluded that Straker was leading a double life, and keeping a second establishment. The nature of the bill showed that there was a lady in the case, and one who had expensive tastes. Liberal as you are with your servants, one hardly expects that they can buy twenty-guinea walking-dresses for their women. I questioned Mrs Straker as to the dress without her knowing it, and having satisfied myself that it had never reached her, I made a note of the milliner’s address, and felt that by calling there with Straker’s photograph, I could easily dispose of the mythical Darbyshire. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000238" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000238">‘From that time on all was plain. Straker had led out the horse to a hollow where his light would be invisible. Simpson, in his flight, had dropped his cravat, and Straker had picked it up with some idea, perhaps, that he might use it in securing the horse’s leg. Once in the hollow he had got behind the horse, and had struck a light, but the creature, frightened at the sudden glare, and with the strange instinct of animals feeling that some mischief was intended, had lashed out, and the steel shoe had struck Straker full on the forehead. He had already, in spite of the rain, taken off his overcoat in order to do his delicate task, and so, as he fell, his knife gashed his thigh. Do I make it clear?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000239" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000239">‘Wonderful!’ cried the colonel. ‘Wonderful! You might have been there.’</p>

It struck me that so astute a man as Straker would not undertake this delicate tendon-nicking without a little practice. What could he practise on? My eyes fell upon the sheep, and I asked a question which, rather to my surprise, showed that my surmise was correct.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000241" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000241">‘You have made it perfectly clear, Mr Holmes.’</p>

And this is not so much for the sake of his reputation, for indeed it was when he was at his wits’ end that his energy and his versatility were most admirable, but because where he failed it happened too often that no one else succeeded, and that the tale was left for ever without a conclusion. Now and again, however, it chanced that even when he erred the truth was still discovered. I have notes of some half-dozen cases of the kind, of which the affair of the second stain, and that which I am now about to recount, are the two which present the strongest features of interest. </span></p>
        <p id="chapter003-p36" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p36">Sherlock Holmes was a man who seldom took exercise for exercise’s sake. Few men were capable of greater muscular effort, and he was undoubtedly one of the finest boxers of his weight that I have ever seen; but he looked upon aimless bodily exertion as a waste of energy, and he seldom bestirred himself save where there was some professional object to be served. Then he was absolutely untiring and indefatigable. That he should have kept himself in training under such circumstances is remarkable, but his diet was usually of the sparest, and his habits were simple to the verge of austerity. Save for the occasional use of cocaine he had no vices, and he only turned to the drug as a protest against the monotony of existence when cases were scanty and the papers uninteresting. </p>

At last he goes out into the passage and he cries: “Is that man never goin’ to come?” Those were his very words, sir. “You’ll only need to wait a little longer,” says I. “Then I’ll wait in the open air, for I feel half choked,” says he. “I’ll be back before long,” and with that he ups and he outs, and all I could say wouldn’t hold him back.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p37" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p37">‘Well, well, you did your best,’ said Holmes, as we walked into our room. ‘It’s very annoying though, Watson. I was badly in need of a case, and this looks, from the man’s impatience, as if it were of importance. Halloa! that’s not your pipe on the table! He must have left his behind him. A nice old briar, with a good long stem of what the tobacconists call amber. I wonder how many real amber mouthpieces there are in London. Some people think a fly in it is a sign. Why, it is quite a branch of trade, the putting of sham flies into the sham amber. Well, he must have been disturbed in his mind to leave a pipe behind him which he evidently values highly.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000253" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000253">‘How do you know that he values it highly?’ I asked.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000254" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000254">‘Well, I should put the original cost of the pipe at seven-and-sixpence. Now it has, you see, been twice mended: once in the wooden stem and once in the amber. Each of these mends, done, as you observe, with silver bands, must have cost more than the pipe did originally. The man must value the pipe highly when he prefers to patch it up rather than buy a new one with the same money.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000255" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000255">‘Anything else?’ I asked, for Holmes was turning the pipe about in his hand and staring at it in his peculiar, pensive way.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000256" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000256">He held it up and tapped on it with his long, thin forefinger as a professor might who was lecturing on a bone.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000257" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000257">‘Pipes are occasionally of extraordinary interest,’ said he. ‘Nothing has more individuality save, perhaps, watches and bootlaces. The indications here, however, are neither very marked nor very important. The owner is obviously a muscular man, left-handed, with an excellent set of teeth, careless in his habits, and with no need to practise economy.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000258" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000258">My friend threw out the information in a very offhand way, but I saw that he cocked his eye at me to see if I had followed his reasoning. </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p38" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p38">‘You think a man must be well-to-do if he smokes a seven-shilling pipe?’ said I. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000259" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000259">‘This is Grosvenor mixture at eightpence an ounce,’ Holmes answered, knocking a little out on his palm. ‘As he might get an excellent smoke for half the price, he has no need to practise economy.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000260" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000260">‘And the other points?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000261" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000261">‘He has been in the habit of lighting his pipe at lamps and gas-jets. You can see that it is quite charred all down one side. Of course, a match could not have done that. Why should a man hold a match to the side of his pipe? But you cannot light it at a lamp without getting the bowl charred. And it is on the right side of the pipe. From that I gather that he is a left-handed man. You hold your own pipe to the lamp, and see how naturally you, being right-handed, hold the left side to the flame. You might do it once the other way, but not as a constancy. This has always been held so. Then he has bitten through his amber. It takes a muscular, energetic fellow, and one with a good set of teeth, to do that. But if I am not mistaken I hear him upon the stair, so we shall have something more interesting than his pipe to study.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000262" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000262">An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the room. He was well but quietly dressed in a dark-grey suit, and carried a brown wide-awake in his hand. I should have put him at about thirty, though he was really some years older. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000263" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000263">‘I beg your pardon,’ said he, with some embarrassment; ‘I suppose I should have knocked. Yes, of course I should have knocked. The fact is that I am a little upset, and you must put it all down to that.’ He passed his hand over his forehead like a man who is half dazed, and then fell, rather than sat, down upon a chair. </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p39" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p39">‘I can see that you have not slept for a night or two,’ said Holmes, in his easy, genial way. ‘That tries a man’s nerves more than work, and more even than pleasure. May I ask how I can help you?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000264" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000264">‘I wanted your advice, sir. I don’t know what to do, and my whole life seems to have gone to pieces.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000267" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000267">He spoke in little, sharp, jerky outbursts, and it seemed to me that to speak at all was very painful to him, and that his will all through was overriding his inclinations. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000268" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000268">‘It’s a very delicate thing,’ said he. ‘One does not like to speak of one’s domestic affairs to strangers. It seems dreadful to discuss the conduct of one’s wife with two men whom I have never seen before. It’s horrible to have to do it. But I’ve got to the end of my tether, and I must have advice.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000270" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000270">Our visitor sprang from his chair. ‘What!’ he cried. ‘You know my name?’</p>

I was about to say that my friend and I have listened to many strange secrets in this room, and that we have had the good fortune to bring peace to many troubled souls. I trust that we may do as much for you. Might I beg you, as time may prove to be of importance, to furnish me with the facts of your case without further delay?’ </span></p>
        <p id="chapter003-p40" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p40">Our visitor again passed his hand over his forehead as if he found it bitterly hard. From every gesture and expression I could see that he was a reserved, self-contained man, with a dash of pride in his nature, more likely to hide his wounds than to expose them. Then suddenly, with a fierce gesture of his closed hand, like one who throws reserve to the winds, he began. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000272" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000272">‘The facts are these, Mr Holmes,’ said he. ‘I am a married man, and have been so for three years. During that time my wife and I have loved each other as fondly, and lived as happily, as any two that ever were joined. We have not had a difference, not one, in thought, or word, or deed. And now, since last Monday, there has suddenly sprung up a barrier between us, and I find that there is something in her life and in her thoughts of which I know as little as if she were the woman who brushes by me in the street. We are estranged, and I want to know why. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000273" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000273">‘Now there is one thing I want to impress upon you before I go any further, Mr Holmes: Effie loves me. Don’t let there be any mistake about that. She loves me with her whole heart and soul, and never more than now. I know it, I feel it. I don’t want to argue about that. A man can tell easily enough when a woman loves him. But there’s this secret between us, and we can never be the same until it is cleared.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000274" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000274">‘Kindly let me have the facts, Mr Munro,’ said Holmes, with some impatience.</p>
        <p id="chapter003-p41" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p41">‘I’ll tell you what I know about Effie’s history. She was a widow when I met her first, though quite young – only twenty-five. Her name then was Mrs Hebron. She went out to America when she was young and lived in the town of Atlanta, where she married this Hebron, who was a lawyer with a good practice. They had one child, but the yellow fever broke out badly in the place, and both husband and child died of it. I have seen his death certificate. This sickened her of America, and she came back to live with a maiden aunt at Pinner, in Middlesex. I may mention that her husband had left her comfortably off, and that she had a capital of about four thousand five hundred pounds, which had been so well invested by him that it returned an average of seven per cent. She had only been six months at Pinner when I met her; we fell in love with each other, and we married a few weeks afterwards. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000275" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000275">‘I am a hop merchant myself, and as I have an income of seven or eight hundred, we found ourselves comfortably off, and took a nice eighty-pound-a-year villa at Norbury. Our little place was very countrified, considering that it is so close to town. We had an inn and two houses a little above us, and a single cottage at the other side of the field which faces us, and except those there were no houses until you get half-way to the station. My business took me into town at certain seasons, but in summer I had less to do, and then in our country home my wife and I were just as happy as could be wished. I tell you that there never was a shadow between us until this accursed affair began. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000276" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000276">‘There’s one thing I ought to tell you before I go further. When we married, my wife made over all her property to me – rather against my will, for I saw how awkward it would be if my business affairs went wrong. However, she would have it so, and it was done. Well, about six weeks ago she came to me. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000277" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000277">‘“Jack,” said she, “when you took my money you said that if ever I wanted any I was to ask you for it.”</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000278" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000278">‘“Certainly,” said I, “it’s all your own.”</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000279" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000279">‘“Well,” said she, “I want a hundred pounds.”</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000286" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000286">‘So I had to be content with that, though it was the first time that there had ever been any secret between us. I gave her a cheque, and I never thought any more of the matter. It may have nothing to do with what came afterwards, but I thought it only right to mention it. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000287" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000287">‘Well, I told you just now that there is a cottage not far from our house. There is just a field between us, but to reach it you have to go along the road and then turn down a lane. Just beyond it is a nice little grove of Scotch firs, and I used to be very fond of strolling down there, for trees are always neighbourly kinds of things. The cottage had been standing empty this eight months, and it was a pity, for it was a pretty two-storied place, with an old-fashioned porch and honeysuckle about it. I have stood many a time and thought what a neat little homestead it would make. </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p43" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p43">‘Well, last Monday evening I was taking a stroll down that way, when I met an empty van coming up the lane, and saw a pile of carpets and things lying about on the grass-plot beside the porch. It was clear that the cottage had at last been let. I walked past it, and then stopping, as an idle man might, I ran my eye over it, and wondered what sort of folk they were who had come to live so near us. And as I looked I suddenly became aware that a face was watching me out of one of the upper windows. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000288" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000288">‘I don’t know what there was about that face, Mr Holmes, but it seemed to send a chill right down my back. I was some little way off, so that I could not make out the features, but there was something unnatural and inhuman about the face. That was the impression I had, and I moved quickly forward to get a nearer view of the person who was watching me. But as I did so the face suddenly disappeared, so suddenly that it seemed to have been plucked away into the darkness of the room. I stood for five minutes thinking the business over, and trying to analyse my impressions. I could not tell if the face was that of a man or a woman. But the colour was what impressed me most. It was of a livid dead yellow, and with something set and rigid about it, which was shockingly unnatural. So disturbed was I that I determined to see a little more of the new inmates of the cottage. I approached and knocked at the door, which was instantly opened by a tall, gaunt woman, with a harsh, forbidding face. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000289" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000289">‘“What may you be wantin’?” she asked, in a northern accent.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000290" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000290">‘“I am your neighbour over yonder,” said I, nodding towards my house. “I see that you have only just moved in, so I thought that if I could be of any help to you in any—” </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p44" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p44">‘“Aye, we’ll just ask ye when we want ye,” said she, and shut the door in my face. Annoyed at the churlish rebuff, I turned my back and walked home. All the evening, though I tried to think of other things, my mind would still turn to the apparition at the window and the rudeness of the woman. I determined to say nothing about the former to my wife, for she is a nervous, highly-strung woman, and I had no wish that she should share the unpleasant impression which had been produced upon myself. I remarked to her, however, before I fell asleep that the cottage was now occupied, to which she returned no reply. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000291" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000291">‘I am usually an extremely sound sleeper. It has been a standing jest in the family that nothing could ever wake me during the night; and yet somehow on that particular night, whether it may have been the slight excitement produced by my little adventure or not, I know not, but I slept much more lightly than usual. Half in my dreams I was dimly conscious that something was going on in the room, and gradually became aware that my wife had dressed herself and was slipping on her mantle and her bonnet. My lips were parted to murmur out some sleepy words of surprise or remonstrance at this untimely preparation, when suddenly my half-opened eyes fell upon her face, illuminated by the candle light, and astonishment held me dumb. She wore an expression such as I had never seen before – such as I should have thought her incapable of assuming. She was deadly pale, and breathing fast, glancing furtively towards the bed, as she fastened her mantle, to see if she had disturbed me. Then, thinking that I was still asleep, she slipped noiselessly from the room, and an instant later I heard a sharp creaking, which could only come from the hinges of the front door. I sat up in bed and rapped my knuckles against the rail to make certain that I was truly awake. Then I took my watch from under the pillow. It was three in the morning. What on this earth could my wife be doing out on the country road at three in the morning? </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p45" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p45">‘I had sat for about twenty minutes turning the thing over in my mind and trying to find some possible explanation.

My wife had always been a woman of a frank, open nature, and it gave me a chill to see her slinking into her own room, and crying out and wincing when her own husband spoke to her. </p>

The fact is, that I felt as though I were choking, and had a perfect longing for a breath of fresh air. I really think that I should have fainted if I had not gone out. I stood at the door for a few minutes, and now I am quite myself again.” </p>

What was it that my wife was concealing from me? Where had she been during that strange expedition? I felt that I should have no peace until I knew, and yet I shrank from asking her again after once she had told me what was false. All the rest of the night I tossed and tumbled, framing theory after theory, each more unlikely than the last. </p>

My wife seemed to be as upset as myself, and I could see from the little questioning glances which she kept shooting at me that she understood that I disbelieved her statement, and that she was at her wits’ end what to do. We hardly exchanged a word during breakfast, and immediately afterwards I went out for a walk, that I might think the matter over in the fresh morning air. </p>

If you force your way into that cottage, all is over between us.” </p>

Come away, oh, come away up to the house!” Still plucking at my sleeve she led me away from the cottage. As we went I glanced back, and there was that yellow, livid face watching us out of the upper window. What link could there be between that creature and my wife? Or how could the coarse, rough woman whom I had seen the day before be connected with her? It was a strange puzzle, and yet I knew that my mind could never know ease again until I had solved it. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000310" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000310">‘For two days after this I stayed at home, and my wife appeared to abide loyally by our engagement, for, as far as I know, she never stirred out of the house. On the third day, however, I had ample evidence that her solemn promise was not enough to hold her back from this secret influence which drew her away from her husband and her duty. </p>

I rushed upstairs to make sure that she was not in the house. As I did so I happened to glance out of one of the upper windows, and saw the maid with whom I had just been speaking running across the field in the direction of the cottage. Then, of course, I saw exactly what it all meant. My wife had gone over there and had asked the servant to call her if I should return. Tingling with anger, I rushed down and strode across, determined to end the matter once and for ever. I saw my wife and the maid hurrying back together along the lane, but I did not stop to speak with them. In the cottage lay the secret which was casting a shadow over my life. I vowed that, come what might, it should be a secret no longer. I did not even knock when I reached it, but turned the handle and rushed into the passage. </p>

In the kitchen a kettle was singing on the fire, and a large black cat lay coiled up in a basket, but there was no sign of the woman whom I had seen before. I ran into the other room, but it was equally deserted. Then I rushed up the stairs, but only to find two other rooms empty and deserted at the top. There was no one at all in the whole house. The furniture and pictures were of the most common and vulgar description, save in the one chamber at the window of which I had seen the strange face. That was comfortable and elegant, and all my suspicions rose into a fierce, bitter blaze when I saw that on the mantelpiece stood a full-length photograph of my wife, which had been taken at my request only three months ago. </p>

It is the first shadow that has come between us, and it has so shaken me that I do not know what I should do for the best. Suddenly this morning it occurred to me that you were the man to advise me, so I have hurried to you now, and I place myself unreservedly in your hands. If there is any point which I have not made clear, pray question me about it. But above all tell me quickly what I have to do, for this misery is more than I can bear.’ </p>

If the cottage is permanently deserted we may have some difficulty; if on the other hand, as I fancy is more likely, the inmates were warned of your coming, and left before you entered yesterday, then they may be back now, and we should clear it all up easily. Let me advise you, then, to return to Norbury and to examine the windows of the cottage again. If you have reason to believe that it is inhabited do not force your way in, but send a wire to my friend and me.

The facts, as I read them, are something like this: this woman was married in America. Her husband developed some hateful qualities, or, shall we say, he contracted some loathsome disease, and became a leper or an imbecile. She fled from him at last, returned to England, changed her name, and started her life, as she thought, afresh. She had been married three years, and believed that her position was quite secure – having shown her husband the death certificate of some man whose name she had assumed – when suddenly her whereabouts was discovered by her first husband, or, we may suppose, by some unscrupulous woman, who had attached herself to the invalid. They write to the wife and threaten to come and expose her. She asks for a hundred pounds and endeavours to buy them off. They come in spite of it, and when the husband mentions casually to the wife that there are new-comers in the cottage, she knows in some way that they are her pursuers. She waits until her husband is asleep, and then she rushes down to endeavour to persuade them to leave her in peace. Having no success, she goes again next morning, and her husband meets her, as he told us, as she came out. She promises him then not to go there again, but two days afterwards, the hope of getting rid of those dreadful neighbours is too strong for her, and she makes another attempt, taking down with her the photograph which had probably been demanded from her. In the midst of this interview the maid rushes in to say that the master has come home, on which the wife, knowing that he would come straight down to the cottage, hurries the inmates out at the back door, into that grove of fir trees probably which was mentioned as standing near. In this way he finds the place deserted. I shall be very much surprised, however, if it is still so when he reconnoitres it this evening. What do you think of my theory?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000345" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000345">‘It is all surmise.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000348" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000348">He was waiting on the platform when we stepped out, and we could see in the light of the station lamps that he was very pale, and quivering with agitation. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000354" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000354">It was a very dark night and a thin rain began to fall as we turned from the high road into a narrow lane, deeply rutted, with hedges on either side. Mr Grant Munro pushed impatiently forward, however, and we stumbled after him as best we could. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000355" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000355">‘There are the lights of my house,’ he murmured, pointing to a glimmer among the trees, ‘and here is the cottage which I am going to enter.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000356" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000356">We turned a corner in the lane as he spoke, and there was the building close beside us. A yellow bar falling across the black foregound showed that the door was not quite closed, and one window in the upper storey was brightly illuminated. As we looked we saw a dark blur moving across the blind. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000357" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000357">‘There is that creature,’ cried Grant Munro; ‘you can see for yourselves that someone is there. Now follow me, and we shall soon know all.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000358" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000358">We approached the door, but suddenly a woman appeared out of the shadow and stood in the golden track of the lamp-light. I could not see her face in the darkness, but her arms were thrown out in an attitude of entreaty. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000359" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000359">‘For God’s sake, don’t, Jack!’ she cried. ‘I had a presentiment that you would come this evening. Think better of it, dear! Trust me again, and you will never have cause to regret it.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter003-p55" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p55">‘I have trusted you too long, Effie!’ he cried sternly. ‘Leave go of me! I must pass you. My friends and I are going to settle this matter once and for ever.’ He pushed her to one side and we followed closely after him. As he threw the door open an elderly woman ran out in front of him and tried to bar his passage, but he thrust her back, and an instant afterwards we were all upon the stairs. Grant Munro rushed into the lighted room at the top, and we entered it at his heels. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000360" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000360">It was a cosy, well-furnished apartment, with two candles burning upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face was turned away as we entered, but we could see that she was dressed in a red frock, and that she had long white gloves on. As she whisked round to us I gave a cry of surprise and horror. The face which she turned towards us was of the strangest livid tint, and the features were absolutely devoid of any expression. An instant later the mystery was explained. Holmes, with a laugh, passed his hand behind the child’s ear, a mask peeled off from her countenance, and there was a little coal-black Negress with all her white teeth flashing in amusement at our amazed faces. I burst out laughing out of sympathy with her merriment, but Grant Munro stood staring, with his hand clutching at his throat. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000361" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000361">‘My God!’ he cried, ‘what can be the meaning of this?’</p>

My husband died at Atlanta. My child survived.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000363" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#p_000363">‘Your child!’</p>
        <p id="chapter003-p56" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00001.smil#chapter003-p56">She drew a large silver locket from her bosom. ‘You have never seen this open.’ </p>

I cut myself off from my race in order to wed him; but never once while he lived did I for one instant regret it. It was our misfortune that our only child took after his people rather than mine. It is often so in such matches, and little Lucy is darker far than ever her father was. But, dark or fair, she is my own dear little girlie, and her mother’s pet.’ The little creature ran across at the words and nestled up against the lady’s dress. </p>

She was given to the care of a faithful Scotchwoman who had once been our servant. Never for an instant did I dream of disowning her as my child. But when chance threw you in my way, Jack, and I learned to love you, I feared to tell you about my child. God forgive me, I feared that I should lose you, and I had not the courage to tell you. I had to choose between you, and in my weakness I turned away from my own little girl. For three years I have kept her existence a secret from you, but I heard from the nurse, and I knew that all was well with her. At last, however, there came an overwhelming desire to see the child once more. I struggled against it, but in vain. Though I knew the danger I determined to have the child over, if it were but for a few weeks. I sent a hundred pounds to the nurse, and I gave her instructions about this cottage, so that she might come as a neighbour without my appearing to be in any way connected with her. I pushed my precautions so far as to order her to keep the child in the house during the daytime, and to cover up her little face and hands, so that even those who might see her at the window should not gossip about there being a black child in the neighbourhood. If I had been less cautious I might have been more wise, but I was half crazy with fear lest you should learn the truth. </p>

I should have waited for the morning, but I could not sleep for excitement, and so at last I slipped out, knowing how difficult it is to awaken you. But you saw me go, and that was the beginning of my troubles. Next day you had my secret at your mercy, but you nobly refrained from pursuing your advantage. Three days later, however, the nurse and child only just escaped from the back door as you rushed in at the front one. And now tonight you at last know all, and I ask you what is to become of us, my child and me?’ She clasped her hands and waited for an answer. </p>

Old Mr Farquhar, from whom I purchased it, had at one time an excellent general practice, but his age, and an affliction of the nature of St Vitus’s dance from which he suffered, had very much thinned it. The public, not unnaturally, goes upon the principle that he who would heal others must himself be whole, and looks askance at the curative powers of the man whose own case is beyond the reach of his drugs. Thus, as my predecessor weakened, his practice declined, until when I purchased it from him it had sunk from twelve hundred to little more than three hundred a year. I had confidence, however, in my own youth and energy, and was convinced that in a very few years the concern would be as flourishing as ever. </span></p>

The glint of the gold in each case caught my eye, you see. When I put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course, you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent me from London to Birmingham; why had he got there before me; and why had he written a letter from himself to himself? It was altogether too much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr Sherlock Holmes. I had just time to get up to town by the night train, to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me to Birmingham.’ </p>

A voice within bade us ‘Come in’, and we entered a bare, unfurnished room, such as Hall Pycroft had described. At the single table sat the man whom we had seen in the street, with his evening paper spread out in front of him, and as he looked up at us it seemed to me that I had never looked upon a face which bore such marks of grief, and of something beyond grief – of a horror such as comes to few men in a lifetime. His brow glistened with perspiration, his cheeks were of the dull dead white of a fish’s belly, and his eyes were wild and staring. He looked at his clerk as though he failed to recognise him, and I could see, by the astonishment depicted upon our conductor’s face, that this was by no means the usual appearance of his employer. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000486" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000486">‘One is Mr Harris, of Bermondsey, and the other is Mr Price of this town,’ said our clerk glibly. ‘They are friends of mine, and gentlemen of experience, but they have been out of a place for some little time, and they hoped that perhaps you might find an opening for them in the company’s employment.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter004-p74" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#chapter004-p74">‘Very possibly!

I will be entirely at your service in three minutes, if I might trespass upon your patience so far.’ He rose with a very courteous air, and bowing to us he passed out through a door at the farther end of the room, which he closed behind him. </p>

Glancing at Holmes I saw his face turn rigid, and he leaned forward in intense excitement. Then suddenly came a low gurgling, gargling sound and a brisk drumming upon woodwork. Holmes sprang frantically across the room and pushed at the door. It was fastened on the inner side. Following his example, we threw ourselves upon it with all our weight. One hinge snapped, then the other, and down came the door with a crash. Rushing over it we found ourselves in the inner room. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000508" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000508">It was empty.</p>

At one corner, the corner nearest the room which we had left, there was a second door. Holmes sprang to it and pulled it open. A coat and waistcoat were lying on the floor, and from a hook behind the door, with his own braces round his neck, was hanging the managing director of the Franco-Midland Hardware Company. His knees were drawn up, his head hung at a dreadful angle to his body, and the clatter of his heels against the door made the noise which had broken in upon our conversation. In an instant I had caught him round the waist and held him up, while Holmes and Pycroft untied the elastic bands which had disappeared between the livid creases of skin. Then we carried him into the other room, where he lay with a slate-coloured face, puffing his purple lips in and out with every breath – a dreadful wreck of all that he had been but five minutes before. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000509" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000509">‘What do you think of him, Watson?’ asked Holmes.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000510" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000510">I stooped over him and examined him.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000511" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000511">‘It has been touch and go with him,’ said I, ‘but he’ll live now. Just open that window and hand me the water carafe.’ I undid his collar, poured the cold water over his face, and raised and sank his arms until he drew a long natural breath. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000523" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000523">‘I am afraid I miss the point.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000525" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000525">‘And why?’</p>

There can be only one adequate reason. Someone wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen of it first. And now if we pass on to the second point, we find that each throws light upon the other. That point is the request made by Pinner that you should not resign your place, but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a Mr Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the Monday morning.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000527" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000527">‘My God!’ cried our client, ‘what a blind beetle I have been!’</p>
        <p id="chapter004-p78" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#chapter004-p78">‘Now you see the point about the handwriting. Suppose that someone turned up in your place who wrote a completely different hand from that in which you had applied for the vacancy, of course the game would have been up. But in the interval the rogue learned to imitate you, and his position was therefore secure, as I presume that nobody in the office had ever set eyes upon you?’ </p>

Of course, it was of the utmost importance to prevent you from thinking better of it, and also to keep you from coming into contact with anyone who might tell you that your double was at work in Mawson’s office. Therefore they gave you a handsome advance on your salary, and ran you off to the Midlands, where they gave you enough work to do to prevent your going to London, where you might have burst their little game up. That is all plain enough.’ </p>

The other is personating you at the office. This one acted as your engager, and then found that he could not find you an employer without admitting a third person into his plot. That he was most unwilling to do. He changed his appearance as far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance. But for the happy chance of the gold stuffing your suspicions would probably have never been aroused.’ </p>

          <p class="noindent" id="chapter004-p80" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#chapter004-p80">A desperate attempt at robbery, culminating in the death of one man and the capture of the criminal, occurred this afternoon in the City. For some time back Mawson &amp; Williams, the famous financial house, have been the guardians of securities which amount in the aggregate to a sum of considerably over a million sterling. So conscious was the manager of the responsibility which devolved upon him in consequence of the great interests at stake, that safes of the very latest construction have been employed, and an armed watchman has been left day and night in the building. It appears that last week a new clerk, named Hall Pycroft, was engaged by the firm. This person appears to have been none other than Beddington, the famous forger and cracksman, who, with his brother, has only recently emerged from a five years’ spell of penal servitude. By some means, which are not yet clear, he succeeded in winning, under a false name, this official position in the office, which he utilised in order to obtain mouldings of various locks, and a thorough knowledge of the position of the strong room and the safes. </p>
          <p id="chapter004-p81" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#chapter004-p81">It is customary at Mawson’s for the clerks to leave at midday on Saturday. Sergeant Tuson, of the City Police, was somewhat surprised therefore to see a gentleman with a carpet bag come down the steps at twenty minutes past one. His suspicions being aroused, the sergeant followed the man, and with the aid of Constable Pollock succeeded, after a most desperate resistance, in arresting him. It was at once clear that a daring and gigantic robbery had been committed. Nearly a hundred thousand pounds’ worth of American railway bonds, with a large amount of scrip in other mines and companies, were discovered in the bag. On examining the premises the body of the unfortunate watchman was found doubled up and thrust into the largest of the safes, where it would not have been discovered until Monday morning had it not been for the prompt action of Sergeant Tuson. The man’s skull had been shattered by a blow from a poker, delivered from behind. There could be no doubt that Beddington had obtained entrance by pretending that he had left something behind him, and, having murdered the watchman, rapidly rifled the large safe, and then made off with his booty. His brother, who usually works with him, has not appeared in this job, as far as can at present be ascertained, although the police are making energetic enquiries as to his whereabouts. </p>

You see that even a villain and a murderer can inspire such affection that his brother turns to suicide when he learns that his neck is forfeited. However, we have no choice as to our action. The doctor and I will remain on guard, Mr Pycroft, if you will have the kindness to step out for the police.’ </p>

I was never a very sociable fellow, Watson, always rather fond of moping in my rooms and working out my own little methods of thought, so that I never mixed much with the men of my year. Bar fencing and boxing I had few athletic tastes, and then my line of study was quite distinct from that of the other fellows, so that we had no points of contact at all. Trevor was the only man I knew, and that only through the accident of his bullterrier freezing on to my ankle one morning as I went down to chapel. </p>
        <p id="chapter005-p85" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#chapter005-p85">‘It was a prosaic way of forming a friendship, but it was effective. I was laid by the heels for ten days, and Trevor used to come in to enquire after me. At first it was only a minute’s chat, but soon his visits lengthened, and before the end of the term we were close friends. He was a hearty, full-blooded fellow, full of spirit and energy, the very opposite to me in most respects; but we found we had some subjects in common, and it was a bond of union when I learned that he was as friendless as I. Finally, he invited me down to his father’s place at Donnithorpe, in Norfolk, and I accepted his hospitality for a month of the long vacation. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000552" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000552">‘Old Trevor was evidently a man of some wealth and consideration, a J.P. and a landed proprietor. Donnithorpe is a little hamlet just to the north of Langmere, in the country of the Broads. The house was an old-fashioned, wide-spread, oak-beamed, brick building, with a fine lime-lined avenue leading up to it. There was excellent wild-duck shooting in the fens, remarkably good fishing, a small but select library, taken over, as I understood, from a former occupant, and a tolerable cook, so that it would be a fastidious man who could not put in a pleasant month there. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000553" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00002.smil#p_000553">‘Trevor senior was a widower, and my friend was his only son. There had been a daughter, I heard, but she had died of diphtheria while on a visit to Birmingham. The father interested me extremely. He was a man of little culture, but with a considerable amount of rude strength both physically and mentally. He knew hardly any books, but he had travelled far, had seen much of the world, and had remembered all that he had learned. In person he was a thick-set, burly man, with a shock of grizzled hair, a brown, weather-beaten face, and blue eyes which were keen to the verge of fierceness. Yet he had a reputation for kindness and charity in the countryside, and was noted for the leniency of his sentences from the bench. </p>

His face was thin and brown and crafty, with a perpetual smile upon it which showed an irregular line of yellow teeth, and his crinkled hands were half closed in a way that is distinctive of sailors. As he came slouching across the lawn I heard Mr Trevor make a sort of hiccoughing noise in his throat, and, jumping out of his chair, he ran into the house.

An hour later, when we entered the house we found him stretched dead drunk upon the dining-room sofa.

What was the past of this Trevor: pugilist, traveller, and gold-digger; and how had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman? Why, too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingbridge? Then I remembered that Fordingbridge was in Hampshire, and that this Mr Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit, and presumably to blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But, then, how could the letter be trivial and grotesque as described by the son? He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean another. I must see this letter. If there was a hidden meaning in it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a single sheet of grey paper. “The supply of game for London is going steadily up,” it ran. “Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now told to receive all orders for fly-paper, and for preservation of your hen pheasant’s life.” </p>

Then I re-read it very carefully. It was evidently as I had thought, and some second meaning must be buried in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a prearranged significance to such phrases as “fly-paper” and “hen pheasant”? Such a meaning would be arbitrary, and could not be deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the case, and the presence of the word “Hudson” seemed to show that the subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the combination “Life pheasant’s hen” was not encouraging. Then I tried alternate words, but neither “The of for” nor “supply game London” promised to throw any light upon it. Then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I saw that every third word beginning with the first would give a message which might well drive old Trevor to despair. </p>

The captain, two mates, two warders, Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers, and the doctor were all that we had against us.

He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the captain’s cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an explosion from within, and there he lay with his head on the chart of the Atlantic, which was pinned upon the table, while the chaplain stood, with a smoking pistol in his hand, at his elbow.

We cracked off the necks of the bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing them off, when in an instant, without warning, there came the roar of muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we could not see across the table. When it cleared away again the place was a shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each other on the floor, and the blood and brown sherry on that table turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight that I think we should have given the job up if it had not been for Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop were the lieutenant and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through the slit. We got on them before they could load, and they stood to it like men, but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes it was all over. My God! was there ever a slaughter-house like that ship? Prendergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers up as if they had been children and threw them overboard, alive or dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded, and yet kept on swimming for a surprising time, until someone in mercy blew out his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor. </p>

There were many of us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us, five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done. But there was no moving Prendergast and those who were with him. Our only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the offer, for we were already sick of these bloodthirsty doings, and we saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a suit of sailor’s togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had foundered in lat. 15° N. and long. 25° W., and then cut the painter and let us go. </p>

The seamen had hauled the foreyard a-back during the rising, but now as we left them they brought it square again, and, as there was a light wind from the north and east, the barque began to draw slowly away from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party, were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de Verde was about 500 miles to the north of us, and the African coast about 700 miles to the east. On the whole, as the wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the barque being at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky-line.

When he saw the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand, he kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. </p>

No complaint had been lodged with the police, so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had done away with Beddoes, and had fled. For myself, I believe that the truth was exactly the opposite.

Not that I am in the least conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the coalscuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should distinctly be an open-air pastime; and when Holmes in one of his queer humours would sit in an armchair, with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it. </span></p>

But his papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying documents, especially those which were connected with his past cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he would muster energy to docket and arrange them, for as I have mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with which his name is associated were followed by reactions of lethargy, during which he would lie about with his violin and his books, hardly moving, save from the sofa to the table. Thus month after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by their owner. </p>

He could not deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling a large tin box behind him. This he placed in the middle of the floor, and squatting down upon a stool in front of it he threw back the lid.

After struggling against it until two in the morning I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle with the intention of continuing a novel which I was reading.

You can imagine my surprise when as I looked down this corridor I saw a glimmer of light coming from the open door of the library. I had myself extinguished the lamp and closed the door before coming to bed. Naturally, my first thought was of burglars. The corridors at Hurlstone have their walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons. From one of these I picked a battleaxe, and then, leaving my candle behind me, I crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open door. </p>

He was sitting, fully dressed, in an easy chair, with a slip of paper, which looked like a map, upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand in deep thought. I stood, dumb with astonishment, watching him from the darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a feeble light, which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed. Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the drawers. From this he took a paper, and, returning to his seat, he flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and began to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that I took a step forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me standing in the doorway. He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he had been originally studying. </p>

The taper was still on the table, and by its light I glanced to see what the paper was which Brunton had taken from the bureau. To my surprise it was nothing of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the questions and answers in the singular old observance called the Musgrave Ritual. It is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through upon his coming of age – a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little importance to the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and charges, but of no practical use whatever.” </p>

Oh, yes, he is gone – he is gone!’ She fell back against the wall with shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrified at this sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. The girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while I made enquiries about Brunton. There was no doubt about it that he had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in; he had been seen by no one since he had retired to his room the night before; and yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning. His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room – but the black suit which he usually wore was missing. His slippers, too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. Where, then, could butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become of him now? </p>

It was incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his property behind him, and yet where could he be? I called in the local police, but without success. Rain had fallen on the night before, and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the house, but in vain. Matters were in this state when a new development quite drew our attention away from the original mystery. </p>

I was instantly aroused, and with the two footmen started off at once in search of the missing girl. It was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for, starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they vanished, close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds. The lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine our feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl came to an end at the edge of it. </p>

It was a linen bag, which contained within it a mass of old rusted and discoloured metal and several dull-coloured pieces of pebble or glass. This strange find was all that we could get from the mere, and although we made every possible search and enquiry yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of Rachel Howells or Richard Brunton.

I looked up at the sun. It was low in the heavens, and I calculated that in less than an hour it would lie just above the topmost branches of the old oak. One condition mentioned in the Ritual would then be fulfilled. And the shadow of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the trunk would have been chosen as the guide. I had then to find where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just clear of the oak.’ </p>

Besides, there was no real difficulty. I went with Musgrave to his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long string, with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths of a fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my client to where the elm had been. The sun was just grazing the top of the oak. I fastened the rod on end, marked out the direction of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine feet in length. </p>

If a rod of six feet threw a shadow of nine feet, a tree of sixty-four feet would throw one of ninety-six feet, and the line of one would of course be the line of the other. I measured out the distance, which brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements, and that I was still upon his trail. </p>

Ten steps with each foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again I marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully paced off five to the east and two to the south. It brought me to the very threshold of the old door. Two steps to the west meant now that I was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was the place indicated by the Ritual. </p>

Brunton had not been at work here. I tapped upon the floor, but it sounded the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice.

At one side of this was a squat, brassbound, wooden box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious, old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was furred outside by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood so that a crop of living fungi was growing on the inside of it. Several discs of metal – old coins apparently – such as I hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it contained nothing else. </p>

It was the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and his two arms thrown out on each side of it. The attitude had drawn all the stagnant blood to his face, and no man could have recognised that distorted, liver-coloured countenance; but his height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his missing butler. He had been dead some days, but there was no wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his dreadful end. When his body had been carried from the cellar we found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost as formidable as that with which we had started. </p>

I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions. It is true that I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton, but now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had disappeared. I sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the whole matter carefully over. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000762" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000762">‘You know my methods in such cases, Watson: I put myself in the man’s place, and having first gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same circumstances. In this case the matter was simplified by Brunton’s intelligence being quite first rate, so that it was unnecessary to make any allowance for personal equation, as the astronomers have dubbed it. He knew that something valuable was concealed. He had spotted the place. He found that the stone which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided. What would he do next? He could not get help from outside, even if he had someone whom he could trust, without the unbarring of doors, and considerable risk of detection. It was better, if he could, to have his helpmate inside the house. But whom could he ask? This girl had been devoted to him. A man always finds it hard to realise that he may have finally lost a woman’s love, however badly he may have treated her. He would try by a few attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then would engage her as his accomplice. Together they would come at night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to raise the stone. So far I could follow their actions as if I had actually seen them. </p>
        <p id="chapter006-p132" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter006-p132">‘But for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy work, the raising of that stone. A burly Sussex policeman and I had found it no light job. What would they do to assist them? Probably what I should have done myself. I rose and examined carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered round the floor. Almost at once I came upon what I expected. One piece, about three feet in length, had a marked indentation at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they had been compressed by some considerable weight. Evidently as they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on to the edge of the other slab. So far I was still on safe ground. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000763" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000763">‘And now, how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama? Clearly only one could get into the hole, and that one was Brunton. The girl must have waited above.

Was it a chance that the wood had slipped and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his fate? Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support away and sent the slab crashing down into its place? Be that as it might, I seemed to see that woman’s figure, still clutching at her treasure-trove, and flying wildly up the winding stair with her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her, and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone which was choking her faithless lover’s life out. </p>

Within twenty-four hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there was nothing formidable in his symptoms. His iron constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an investigation which had extended over two months, during which period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days at a stretch. The triumphant issue of his labours could not save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a time when Europe was ringing with his name, and when his room was literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams, I found him a prey to the blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he had succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and that he had outmanoeuvred at every point the most accomplished swindler in Europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his nervous prostration. </p>

My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had come under my professional care in Afghanistan, had now taken a house near Reigate, in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come down to him upon a visit. On the last occasion he had remarked that if my friend would only come with me, he would be glad to extend his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom, he fell in with my plans, and a week after our return from Lyons we were under the colonel’s roof. Hayter was a fine old soldier, who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had expected, that Holmes and he had plenty in common. </p>

We were at breakfast when the colonel’s butler rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000796" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000796">‘Have you heard the news, sir?’ he gasped. ‘At the Cunninghams’, sir!’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000797" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000797">‘Burglary?’ cried the colonel, with his coffee cup in midair.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000799" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000799">The colonel whistled. ‘By Jove!’ said he, ‘who’s killed, then? The J.P. or his son?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000800" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000800">‘Neither, sir. It was William, the coachman. Shot through the heart, sir, and never spoke again.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000801" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000801">‘Who shot him, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000802" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000802">‘The burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got clean away. He’d just broke in at the back door when William came on him and met his end in saving his master’s property.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000803" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000803">‘What time?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000804" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000804">‘It was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000805" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000805">‘Ah, then, we’ll step over presently,’ said the colonel, coolly settling down to his breakfast again. ‘It’s a baddish business,’ he added, when the butler had gone. ‘He’s our leading squire about here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow, too. He’ll be cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years, and was a good servant. It’s evidently the same villains who broke into Acton’s.’ </p>

It may prove the simplest matter in the world; but, all the same, at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not? A gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the same district within a few days. When you spoke last night of taking precautions, I remember that it passed through my mind that this was probably the last parish in England to which the thief or thieves would be likely to turn their attention; which shows that I have still much to learn.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000808" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000808">‘I fancy it’s some local practitioner,’ said the colonel. ‘In that case, of course, Acton’s and Cunningham’s are just the places he would go for, since they are far the largest about here.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000809" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000809">‘And richest?’</p>

Old Acton has some claim on half Cunningham’s estate, and the lawyers have been at it with both hands.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000811" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000811">‘If it’s a local villain, there should not be much difficulty in running him down,’ said Holmes, with a yawn. ‘All right, Watson, I don’t intend to meddle.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000814" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000814">The colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the inspector bowed.</p>

Mr Cunningham saw him from the bedroom window, and Mr Alec Cunningham saw him from the back passage. It was a quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. Mr Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mister Alec was smoking a pipe in his dressing-gown. They both heard William, the coachman, calling for help, and Mister Alec he ran down to see what was the matter. The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. One of them fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across the garden and over the hedge. Mr Cunningham, looking out of his bedroom window, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of him at once. Mister Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying man, and so the villain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he was a middle-sized man, and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no personal clue, but we are making energetic enquiries, and if he is a stranger we shall soon find him out.’ </p>

He lived at the lodge with his mother, and as he was a very faithful fellow, we imagine that he walked up to the house with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course, this Acton business has put everyone on their guard. The robber must have just burst open the door – the lock has been forced – when William came upon him.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000822" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000822">He took a small piece of torn paper from a notebook and spread it out upon his knee.</p>

You see that his murderer might have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it was an appointment.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000824" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000824">Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a facsimile of which is here reproduced.</p>

He may have met him there, may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may have fallen out between themselves.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000827" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000827">‘Your last remark,’ said Holmes, presently, ‘as to the possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to the other, is an ingenious and not entirely an impossible supposition. But this writing opens up—’ He sank his head into his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest thought. When he raised his face I was surprised to see that his cheek was tinged with colour, and his eyes as bright as before his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his old energy. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000828" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000828">‘I’ll tell you what!’ said he. ‘I should like to have a quiet little glance into the details of this case. There is something in it which fascinates me extremely. If you will permit me, Colonel, I will leave my friend Watson and you, and I will step round with the inspector to test the truth of one or two little fancies of mine. I will be with you again in half an hour.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000829" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000829">An hour and a half had elapsed before the inspector returned alone.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000834" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000834">The inspector shrugged his shoulders. ‘I don’t quite know, sir.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000836" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000836">We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trouser pockets.</p>

That was of great interest.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000844" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000844">‘Naturally.’</p>

Because it incriminated him. And what would he do with it? Thrust it into his pocket most likely, never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet, it is obvious that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.’ </p>

The note was sent to William. The man who wrote it could not have taken it, otherwise of course he might have delivered his own message by word of mouth. Who brought the note, then? Or did it come through the post?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000853" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000853">‘I have made enquiries,’ said the inspector. ‘William received a letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was destroyed by him.’ </p>

It is a pleasure to work with you. Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will show you the scene of the crime.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p147" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p147">We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived, and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the door. Holmes and the inspector led us round it until we came to the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the kitchen door. </p>

Old Mr Cunningham was at that window – the second on the left – and he saw the fellow get away just to the left of that bush. So did the son. They are both sure of it on account of the bush. Then Mister Alec ran out and knelt beside the wounded man. The ground is very hard, you see, and there are no marks to guide us.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000856" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000856">As he spoke two men came down the garden path, from round the angle of the house. The one was an elderly man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contrast with the business which had brought us there. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000857" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000857">‘Still at it, then?’ said he to Holmes. ‘I thought you Londoners were never at fault. You don’t seem to be so very quick after all.’ </p>

His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon the ground. Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a large chair and breathed heavily for some minutes. Finally, with a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000861" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000861">‘Watson would tell you that I have only just recovered from a severe illness,’ he explained. ‘I am liable to these sudden nervous attacks.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000863" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000863">‘Well, since I am here there is one point on which I should like to feel sure. We can very easily verify it.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000864" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000864">‘What is it?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000865" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000865">‘Well, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival of this poor fellow William was not before but after the entrance of the burglar into the house. You appear to take it for granted that although the door was forced the robber never got in.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000866" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000866">‘I fancy that is quite obvious,’ said Mr Cunningham gravely. ‘Why, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly have heard anyone moving about.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000867" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000867">‘Where was he sitting?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000868" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000868">‘I was sitting smoking in my dressing-room.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000869" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000869">‘Which window is that?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000870" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000870">‘The last on the left, next to my father’s.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000871" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000871">‘Both your lamps were lit, of course?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000872" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000872">‘Undoubtedly.’</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p149" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p149">‘There are some very singular points here,’ said Holmes, smiling. ‘Is it not extraordinary that a burglar – and a burglar who had had some previous experience – should deliberately break into a house at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the family were still afoot?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000873" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000873">‘He must have been a cool hand.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000874" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000874">‘Well, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not have been driven to ask you for an explanation,’ said Mister Alec. ‘But as to your idea that the man had robbed the house before William tackled him, I think it a most absurd notion. Shouldn’t we have found the place disarranged and missed the things which he had taken?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000875" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000875">‘It depends on what the things were,’ said Holmes. ‘You must remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own. Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from Acton’s – what was it? – a ball of string, a letter-weight, and I don’t know what other odds and ends!’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000876" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000876">‘Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr Holmes,’ said old Cunningham. ‘Anything which you or the inspector may suggest will most certainly be done.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000877" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000877">‘In the first place,’ said Holmes, ‘I should like you to offer a reward – coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I thought.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000878" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000878">‘I would willingly give five hundred,’ said the J.P., taking the slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. ‘This is not quite correct, however,’ he added, glancing over the document. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000879" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000879">‘I wrote it rather hurriedly.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000880" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000880">‘You see you begin: “Whereas, at about a quarter to one on Tuesday morning, an attempt was made” – and so on. It was at a quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p150" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p150">I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would feel any slip of the kind. It was his speciality to be accurate as to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from being himself. He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while the inspector raised his eyebrows and Alec Cunningham burst into a laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and handed the paper back to Holmes. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000881" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000881">‘Get it printed as soon as possible,’ he said. ‘I think your idea is an excellent one.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000882" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000882">Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away in his pocketbook.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000883" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000883">‘And now’, said he, ‘it would really be a good thing that we should all go over the house together, and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000884" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000884">Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had been forced. It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. We could see the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000885" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000885">‘You don’t use bars, then?’ he asked.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000886" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000886">‘We have never found it necessary.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000888" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000888">‘Yes; but he is chained on the other side of the house.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000889" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000889">‘When do the servants go to bed?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000890" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000890">‘About ten.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000891" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000891">‘I understand that William was usually in bed also at that hour?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000892" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000892">‘Yes.’</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p151" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p151">‘It is singular that on this particular night he should have been up. Now, I should be very glad if you would have the kindness to show us over the house, Mr Cunningham.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000893" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000893">A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more ornamental stair which led up from the front hall. Out of this landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including those of Mr Cunningham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking keen note of the architecture of the house. I could tell from his expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000894" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000894">‘My good sir,’ said Mr Cunningham, with some impatience, ‘this is surely very unnecessary. That is my room at the end of the stairs, and my son’s is the one beyond it. I leave it to your judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up here without disturbing us.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000895" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000895">‘You must try round and get on a fresh scent, I fancy,’ said the son, with a rather malicious smile.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000896" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000896">‘Still, I must ask you to humour me a little further. I should like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms command the front. This, I understand, is your son’s room’ – he pushed open the door – ‘and that, I presume, is the dressing-room in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. Where does the window of that look out to?’ He stepped across the bedroom, pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000897" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000897">‘I hope you are satisfied now?’ said Mr Cunningham testily.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000898" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000898">‘Thank you; I think I have seen all that I wished.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000899" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000899">‘Then, if it is really necessary, we can go into my room.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000900" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000900">‘If it is not too much trouble.’</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p152" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p152">The J.P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. As we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of the bed was a small square table, on which stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we passed it, Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The glass smashed into a thousand pieces, and the fruit rolled about into every corner of the room. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000901" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000901">‘You’ve done it now, Watson,’ said he coolly. ‘A pretty mess you’ve made of the carpet.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000902" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000902">I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit, understanding that for some reason my companion desired me to take the blame upon myself. The others did the same, and set the table on its legs again. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000903" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000903">‘Halloa!’ cried the inspector, ‘where’s he got to?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000904" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000904">Holmes had disappeared.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000905" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000905">‘Wait here an instant,’ said young Alec Cunningham. ‘The fellow is off his head, in my opinion. Come with me, father, and see where he has got to!’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000906" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000906">They rushed out of the room, leaving the inspector, the colonel, and me, staring at each other.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000907" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000907">‘’Pon my word, I am inclined to agree with Mister Alec,’ said the official. ‘It may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to me that—’ </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p153" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p153">His words were cut short by a sudden scream of ‘Help! Help! Murder!’With a thrill I recognised the voice as that of my friend. I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. The cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting, came from the room which we had first visited. I dashed in, and on into the dressing-room beyond. The two Cunninghams were bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to be twisting one of his wrists. In an instant the three of us had torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very pale, and evidently greatly exhausted. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000908" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000908">‘Arrest these men, Inspector!’ he gasped.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000909" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000909">‘On what charge?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000910" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000910">‘That of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan!’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000911" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000911">The inspector stared about him in bewilderment. ‘Oh, come now, Mr Holmes,’ said he at last; ‘I am sure you don’t really mean to—’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000912" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000912">‘Tut, man; look at their faces!’ cried Holmes curtly.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000913" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000913">Never, certainly, have I seen a plainer confession of guilt upon human countenances. The older man seemed numbed and dazed, with a heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly marked face. The son, on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style which had characterised him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome features. The inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door, he blew his whistle. Two of his constables came at the call. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000914" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000914">‘I have no alternative, Mr Cunningham,’ said he. ‘I trust that this may all prove to be an absurd mistake; but you can see that— Ah, would you? Drop it!’ He struck out with his hand, and a revolver, which the younger man was in the act of cocking, clattered down upon the floor. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000915" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000915">‘Keep that,’ said Holmes, quickly putting his foot upon it. ‘You will find it useful at the trial. But this is what we really wanted.’ He held up a little crumpled piece of paper. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000916" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000916">‘The remainder of the sheet?’ cried the inspector.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000917" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000917">‘Precisely.’</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p154" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p154">‘And where was it?’ </p>

I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. The inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners; but you will certainly see me back at luncheon time.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000919" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000919">Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o’clock he rejoined us in the colonel’s smoking-room. He was accompanied by a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000920" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000920">‘I wished Mr Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small matter to you,’ said Holmes, ‘for it is natural that he should take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a stormy petrel as I am.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000921" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000921">‘On the contrary,’ answered the colonel warmly, ‘I consider it the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000922" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000922">‘I am afraid that my explanation may disillusion you, but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from anyone who might take an intelligent interest in them. But first, as I am rather shaken by the knocking about which I had in the dressingroom, I think that I shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength has been rather tried of late.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000923" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000923">‘I trust you had no more of those nervous attacks.’</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p155" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p155">Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. ‘We will come to that in its turn,’ said he. ‘I will lay an account of the case before you in its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in my decision. Pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is not perfectly clear to you. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000924" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000924">‘It is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be able to recognise out of a number of facts which are incidental and which vital.

But if it was not he, it must have been Alec Cunningham himself, for by the time the old man had descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a simple one, but the inspector had overlooked it because he had started with the supposition that these county magnates had had nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never having any prejudices and of following docilely wherever fact may lead me, and so in the very first stage of the investigation I found myself looking a little askance at the part which had been played by Mr Alec Cunningham. </span></p>

When I draw your attention to the strong t’s of “at” and “to” and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of “quarter” and “twelve”, you will instantly recognise the fact. A very brief analysis of those four words would enable you to say with the utmost confidence that the “learn” and the “maybe” are written in the stronger hand, and the “what” in the weaker.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000928" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000928">‘By Jove, it’s as clear as day!’ cried the colonel. ‘Why on earth should two men write a letter in such a fashion?’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000930" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000930">‘How do you get at that?’</p>

These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see that the second man had a squeeze to fit his “quarter” in between the “at” and the “to”, showing that the latter were already written. The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the man who planned this affair.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000932" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000932">‘Excellent!’ cried Mr Acton.</p>
        <p id="chapter007-p157" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p157">‘But very superficial,’ said Holmes. ‘We come now, however, to a point which is of importance. You may not be aware that the deduction of a man’s age from his writing is one which has been brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In normal cases one can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. I say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth. In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still retains its legibility, although the t’s have begun to lose their crossings, we can say that the one was a young man, and the other was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000933" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000933">‘Excellent!’ cried Mr Acton again.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000934" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000934">‘There is a further point, however, which is subtler and of greater interest. There is something in common between these hands. They belong to men who are blood-relatives. It may be most obvious to you in the Greek e’s, but to me there are many small points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now of my examination of the paper. There were twenty-three other deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to you. They all tended to deepen the impression upon my mind that the Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter. </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p158" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p158">‘Having got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into the details of the crime and to see how far they would help us. I went up to the house with the inspector, and saw all that was to be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to determine with absolute confidence, caused by a shot from a revolver fired at a distance of something over four yards. There was no powder-blackening on the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling when the shot was fired. Again, both father and son agreed as to the place where the man escaped into the road. At that point, however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the bottom. As there were no indications of boot-marks about this ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon the scene at all. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000935" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000935">‘And now I had to consider the motive of this singular crime. To get at this I endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of the original burglary at Mr Acton’s. I understood from something which the colonel told us that a lawsuit had been going on between you, Mr Acton, and the Cunninghams. Of course, it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your library with the intention of getting at some document which might be of importance in the case.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000936" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000936">‘Precisely so,’ said Mr Acton; ‘there can be no possible doubt as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half their present estate, and if they could have found a single paper – which, fortunately, was in the strong box of my solicitors – they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p159" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p159">‘There you are!’ said Holmes, smiling. ‘It was a dangerous, reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having found nothing, they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man’s hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000937" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000937">‘The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. The inspector was about to tell them the importance which was attached to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000938" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000938">‘Good heavens!’ cried the colonel, laughing. ‘Do you mean to say all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000940" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000940">‘It is an art which is often useful,’ said he. ‘When I recovered I managed by a device, which had, perhaps, some little merit of ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word “twelve” so that I might compare it with the “twelve” upon the paper.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000941" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000941">‘Oh, what an ass I have been!’ I exclaimed.</p>

We then went upstairs together, and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind the door, I contrived by upsetting a table to engage their attention for the moment and slipped back to examine the pockets. I had hardly got the paper, however, which was, as I had expected, in one of them, when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man’s grip on my throat now, and the father had twisted my wrist round in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly desperate. </p>
        <p id="chapter007-p161" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter007-p161">‘I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else’s brains if he could have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart, and made a clean breast of everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr Acton’s, and, having thus got them into his power, proceeded under threats of exposure to levy blackmail upon them. Mister Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare, which was convulsing the countryside, an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot; and, had they only got the whole of the note, and paid a little more attention to detail in their accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might never have been roused.’ </p>

The result shows that the trap was skilfully baited. I am sure that you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p’s and in the tails of the g’s. The absence of the i-dots in the old man’s writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly return much invigorated to Baker Street tomorrow.’ </p>

The same may be said, my dear fellow, for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted to the reader. Now, at present I am in the position of these same readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the strangest cases which ever perplexed a man’s brain, and yet I lack the one or two which are needful to complete my theory. But I’ll have them, Watson, I’ll have them!’ His eyes kindled and a slight flush sprang into his thin cheeks.

It did wonders both in the Crimea and the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every possible occasion. It was commanded up to Monday night by James Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a musket. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000973" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000973">‘Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of a former colour-sergeant in the same corps. There was, therefore, as can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple (for they were still young) found themselves in their new surroundings. They appear, however, to have quickly adapted themselves, and Mrs Barclay has always, I understand, been as popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his brother officers. I may add that she was a woman of great beauty, and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty years, she is still of a striking appearance. </p>
        <p id="chapter008-p167" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter008-p167">‘Colonel Barclay’s family life appears to have been a uniformly happy one. Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair. On the whole, he thinks that Barclay’s devotion to his wife was greater than his wife’s to Barclay. He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from her for a day. She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful, was less obtrusively affectionate. But they were regarded in the regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple. There was absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for the tragedy which was to follow. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000974" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000974">‘Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in his character. He was a dashing, jovial old soldier in his usual mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness. This side of his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his wife. Another fact which had struck Major Murphy, and three out of five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular sort of depression which came upon him at times. As the major expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if by some invisible hand, when he had been joining in the gaieties and chaff of the mess table. For days on end, when the mood was on him, he had been sunk in the deepest gloom. This and a certain tinge of superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his brother officers had observed. The latter peculiarity took the form of a dislike of being left alone, especially after dark. This puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often given rise to comment and conjecture. </p>

The married officers live out of barracks, and the colonel has during all this time occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the North Camp. The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it is not more than thirty yards from the high road. A coachman, a cook and a housemaid form the staff of servants. These, with their master and mistress, were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors. </p>

A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at eight, and Mrs Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be present at it. When leaving the house, she was heard by the coachman to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him that she would be back before long. She then called for Miss Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went off together to their meeting. It lasted forty minutes, and at a quarter-past nine Mrs Barclay returned home, having left Miss Morrison at her door as she passed. </p>

This faces the road, and opens by a large glass folding door on to the lawn. The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it. It was into this room that Mrs Barclay went upon her return. The blinds were not down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs Barclay herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the housemaid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to her usual habits. The colonel had been sitting in the dining-room, but hearing that his wife had returned, he joined her in the morning-room. The coachman saw him cross the hall, and enter it. He was never seen again alive. </p>

She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle, but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside. Naturally enough, she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was still raging. They all agree that only two voices were to be heard, those of Barclay and his wife. Barclay’s remarks were subdued and abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners. The lady’s, on the other hand, were most bitter, and, when she raised her voice, could be plainly heard. “You coward!” she repeated over and over again. “What can be done now? Give me back my life. I will never so much as breathe the same air as you again! You coward! You coward!”Those were scraps of her conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man’s voice, with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman. Convinced that some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove to force it, while scream after scream issued from within. He was unable, however, to make his way in, and the women were too distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him. A sudden thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and round to the lawn, upon which the long French windows opened. One side of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the summertime, and he passed without difficulty into the room. His mistress had ceased to scream, and was stretched insensible upon a couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an armchair, and his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the unfortunate soldier, stone dead, in a pool of his own blood. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000977" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000977">‘Naturally the coachman’s first thought, on finding that he could do nothing for his master, was to open the door. But here an unexpected and singular difficulty presented itself. The key was not on the inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned. The lady, against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to her room, still in a state of insensibility. The colonel’s body was then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the scene of the tragedy. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000978" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000978">‘The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was found to be a ragged cut, some two inches long, at the back part of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt weapon. Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have been. Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club of hard carved wood with a bone handle. The colonel possessed a varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that this club was among his trophies. The servants deny having seen it before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is possible that it may have been overlooked. Nothing else of importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs Barclay’s person, nor upon that of the victim, nor in any part of the room was the missing key to be found. The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from Aldershot. </p>

I think you will acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my observations soon made me realise that it was in truth much more extraordinary than would at first sight appear. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_000979" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_000979">‘Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated. One other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the housemaid. You will remember that on hearing the sound of the quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants. On that first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly anything, and judged by their tones, rather than their words, that they had fallen out. On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she heard the word “David” uttered twice by the lady. The point is of the utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden quarrel. The colonel’s name, you remember, was James. </p>

This was the contortion of the colonel’s face. It had set, according to their account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a human countenance is capable of assuming. More than one person fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect. It was quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused him the utmost horror. This, of course, fitted in well enough with the police theory, if the colonel could have seen his wife making a murderous attack upon him. Nor was the fact of the wound being on the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have turned to avoid the blow. No information could be got from the lady herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of brain fever. </p>

There could be no question that the most distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular disappearance of the door key. A most careful search had failed to discover it in the room. Therefore, it must have been taken from it. But neither the colonel nor the colonel’s wife could have taken it. That was perfectly clear. Therefore a third person must have entered the room. And that third person could only have come in through the window. It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious individual. You know my methods, Watson. There was not one of them which I did not apply to the enquiry. And it ended by my discovering traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming from the road. I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of his footmarks – one on the roadway itself, at the point where he had climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon the stained boards near the window where he had entered. He had apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe marks were much deeper than his heels. But it was not the man who surprised me. It was his companion.’ </p>

Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not much less than two feet long – probably more if there is any tail. But now observe this other measurement. The animal has been moving, and we have the length of its stride. In each case it is only about three inches. You have an indication, you see, of a long body with very short legs attached to it. It has not been considerate enough to leave any of its hair behind it. But its general shape must be what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain and is carnivorous.’ </p>

She was never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she was heard by the coachman chatting with the colonel in a friendly fashion. Now, it was equally certain that immediately on her return she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see her husband, had flown to tea, as an agitated woman will, and, finally, on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine o’clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him. But Miss Morrison had been with her during the whole of that hour and a half. It was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her denial, that she must know something of the matter. </p>

That would account for the angry return and also for the girl’s denial that anything had occurred. Nor would it be entirely incompatible with most of the words overheard. But there was the reference to David, and there was the known affection of the colonel for his wife to weigh against it, to say nothing of the tragic intrusion of this other man, which might, of course, be entirely disconnected with what had gone before. It was not easy to pick one’s steps, but on the whole I was inclined to dismiss the idea that there had been anything between the colonel and Miss Morrison, but more than ever convinced that the young lady held the clue as to what it was which had turned Mrs Barclay to hatred of her husband. I took the obvious course, therefore, of calling upon Miss Morrison, of explaining to her that I was perfectly certain that she held the facts in her possession, and of assuring her that her friend, Mrs Barclay, might find herself in the dock upon a capital charge unless the matter were cleared up. </p>

There is only one lamp in it upon the left-hand side, and as we approached this lamp I saw a man coming towards us with his back very bent, and something like a box slung over one of his shoulders. He appeared to be deformed, for he carried his head low, and walked with his knees bent. We were passing him when he raised his face to look at us in the circle of light thrown by the lamp, and as he did so he stopped and screamed out in a dreadful voice, ‘My God, it’s Nancy!’ Mrs Barclay turned as white as death, and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking creature not caught hold of her.

When I promised her that I would say nothing she kissed me, and I have never seen her since.

There are not such a very great number of civilians, and a deformed man was sure to have attracted attention. I spent a day in the search and by evening – this very evening, Watson – I had run him down. The man’s name is Henry Wood, and he lives in lodgings in the same street in which the ladies met him. He has only been five days in the place. In the character of a registration agent I had a most interesting gossip with his landlady. The man is by trade a conjurer and performer, going round the canteens, after nightfall, and giving a little entertainment at each. He carries some creature about with him in his box, about which the landlady seemed to be in considerable trepidation, for she had never seen an animal like it. He uses it in some of his tricks, according to her account. So much the woman was able to tell me, and also that it was a wonder the man lived, seeing how twisted he was, and that he spoke in a strange tongue sometimes, and that for the last two nights she had heard him groaning and weeping in his bedroom. He was all right as far as money went, but in his deposit he had given her what looked like a bad florin. She showed it to me, Watson, and it was an Indian rupee. </p>

If his own guilty conscience had not struck him down, it is likely enough that I might have had his blood upon my soul. You want me to tell the story? Well, I don’t know why I shouldn’t, for there’s no cause for me to be ashamed of it. </p>

You see me now with my back like a camel and my ribs all awry, but there was a time when Corporal Henry Wood was the smartest man in the 117th Foot. We were in India then, in cantonments, at a place we’ll call Bhurtee. Barclay, who died the other day, was sergeant in the same company as myself, and the belle of the regiment – aye, and the finest girl that ever had the breath of life between her lips – was Nancy Devoy, the daughter of the colour-sergeant. There were two men who loved her, and one whom she loved; and you’ll smile when you look at this poor thing huddled before the fire, and hear me say that it was for my good looks that she loved me. </p>

I was a harum-scarum, reckless lad, and he had had an education, and was already marked for the sword-belt. But the girl held true to me, and it seemed that I would have had her, when the Mutiny broke out, and all Hell was loose in the country. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001030" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001030">‘We were shut up in Bhurtee, the regiment of us, with half a battery of artillery, a company of Sikhs, and a lot of civilians and women-folk. There were ten thousand rebels round us, and they were as keen as a set of terriers round a rat cage. About the second week of it our water gave out, and it was a question whether we could communicate with General Neill’s column, which was moving up country. It was our only chance, for we could not hope to fight our way out with all the women and children, so I volunteered to go out and warn General Neill of our danger. My offer was accepted, and I talked it over with Sergeant Barclay, who was supposed to know the ground better than any other man, and drew up a route by which I might get through the rebel lines. At ten o’clock the same night I started off upon my journey. There were a thousand lives to save, but it was of only one that I was thinking when I dropped over the wall that night. </p>
        <p id="chapter008-p182" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter008-p182">‘My way ran down a dried-up watercourse, which we hoped would screen me from the enemy’s sentries, but as I crept round the corner of it I walked right into six of them, who were crouching down in the dark waiting for me. In an instant I was stunned with a blow, and bound hand and foot. But the real blow was to my heart and not to my head, for as I came to and listened to as much as I could understand of their talk, I heard enough to tell me that my comrade, the very man who had arranged the way I was to take, had betrayed me by means of a native servant into the hands of the enemy. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001031" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001031">‘Well, there’s no need for me to dwell on that part of it. You know now what James Barclay was capable of. Bhurtee was relieved by Neill next day, but the rebels took me away with them in their retreat, and it was many a long year before ever I saw a white face again. I was tortured, and tried to get away, and was captured and tortured again. You can see for yourselves the state in which I was left. Some of them that fled into Nepal took me with them, and then afterwards I was up past Darjeeling. The hill-folk up there murdered the rebels who had me, and I became their slave for a time until I escaped, but instead of going south I had to go north, until I found myself among the Afghans. There I wandered about for many a year, and at last came back to the Punjab, where I lived mostly among the natives, and picked up a living by the conjuring tricks that I had learned. What use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to go back to England, or to make myself known to my old comrades? Even my wish for revenge would not make me do that. I had rather that Nancy and my old pals should think of Harry Wood as having died with a straight back, than see him living and crawling with a stick like a chimpanzee. They never doubted that I was dead, and I meant that they never should. I heard that Barclay had married Nancy, and that he was rapidly rising in the regiment, but even that did not make me speak. </p>

For years I’ve been dreaming of the bright green fields and the hedges of England. At last I determined to see them before I died.

You then, as I understand, followed her home and saw through the window an altercation between her husband and her, in which she doubtless cast his conduct to you in his teeth. Your own feelings overcame you, and you ran across the lawn and broke in upon them.’ </p>

But as I was doing it it seemed to me better to leave it alone and get away, for the thing might look black against me, and anyway my secret would be out if I were taken. In my haste I thrust the key into my pocket, and dropped my stick while I was chasing Teddy, who had run up the curtain. When I got him into his box, from which he had slipped, I was off as fast as I could run.’ </p>

In an instant out there slipped a beautiful reddish-brown creature, thin, and lithe, with the legs of a stoat, a long thin nose, and a pair of the finest red eyes that ever I saw in an animal’s head. </p>

For in those cases in which Holmes has performed some </span><em id="em_000055" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#em_000055">tour de force</em><span class="text" id="span_000085" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#span_000085"> of analytical reasoning, and has demonstrated the value of his peculiar methods of investigation, the facts themselves have often been so slight or so commonplace that I could not feel justified in laying them before the public. On the other hand, it has frequently happened that he has been concerned in some research where the facts have been of the most remarkable and dramatic character, but where the share which he has himself taken in determining their causes has been less pronounced than I, as his biographer, could wish. The small matter which I have chronicled under the heading of “A Study in Scarlet”, and that other later one connected with the loss of the </span><em id="em_000056" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#em_000056">Gloria Scott,</em><span class="text" id="span_000086" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#span_000086"> may serve as examples of this Scylla and Charybdis which are for ever threatening his historian. It may be that, in the business of which I am now about to write, the part which my friend played is not sufficiently accentuated; and yet the whole truth of circumstances is so remarkable that I cannot bring myself to omit it entirely from this series. </span></p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001050" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001050">It had been a close, rainy day in October. Our blinds were half drawn, and Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold, and a thermometer of 90 was no hardship. But the paper was uninteresting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation of Nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only change was when he turned his mind from the evil doer of the town to track down his brother of the country. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001051" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001051">Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation, I had tossed aside the barren paper, and, leaning back in my chair, I fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion’s voice broke in upon my thoughts. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001052" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001052">‘You are right, Watson,’ said he. ‘It does seem a very preposterous way of settling a dispute.’</p>

After throwing down your paper, which was the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves upon your newly-framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes turned across to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon the top of your books. You then glanced up at the wall, and of course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the portrait were framed, it would just cover that bare space and correspond with Gordon’s picture over there.’ </p>

But now your thoughts went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher’s career. I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time of the Civil War, for I remember you expressing your passionate indignation at the way in which he was received by the more turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it, that I knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled, and your hands clenched, I was positive that you were indeed thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the ridiculous side of this method of settling international questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I agreed with you that it was preposterous, and was glad to find that all my deductions had been correct.’ </p>

For three hours we strolled about together, watching the ever-changing kaleidoscope of life as it ebbs and flows through Fleet Street and the Strand. Holmes’s characteristic talk, with its keen observance of detail and subtle power of inference, held me amused and enthralled. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001067" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001067">It was ten o’clock before we reached Baker Street again. A brougham was waiting at our door.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001069" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001069">I was sufficiently conversant with Holmes’s methods to be able to follow his reasoning, and to see that the nature and state of the various medical instruments in the wicker basket which hung in the lamp-light inside the brougham had given him the data for his swift deduction. The light in our window above showed that this late visit was indeed intended for us. With some curiosity as to what could have sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I followed Holmes into our sanctum. </p>
        <p id="chapter009-p192" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter009-p192">A pale, taper-faced man with sandy whiskers rose up from a chair by the fire as we entered. His age may not have been more than three or four and thirty, but his haggard expression and unhealthy hue told of a life which had sapped his strength and robbed him of his youth. His manner was nervous and shy, like that of a sensitive gentleman, and the thin white hand which he laid on the mantelpiece as he rose was that of an artist rather than of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and sombre, a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of colour about his necktie. </p>

This, however, is beside the question, Mr Sherlock Holmes, and I quite appreciate how valuable your time is.

I am a London University man, you know, and I am sure you will not think that I am unduly singing my own praises if I say that my student career was considered by my professors to be a very promising one. After I had graduated I continued to devote myself to research, occupying a minor position in King’s College Hospital, and I was fortunate enough to excite considerable interest by my research into the pathology of catalepsy, and finally to win the Bruce Pinkerton prize and medal by the monograph on nervous lesions to which your friend has just alluded. I should not go too far if I were to say that there was a general impression at that time that a distinguished career lay before me. </p>

As you will readily understand, a specialist who aims high is compelled to start in one of a dozen streets in the Cavendish Square quarter, all of which entail enormous rents and furnishing expenses. Besides this preliminary outlay, he must be prepared to keep himself for some years, and to hire a presentable carriage and horse. To do this was quite beyond my power, and I could only hope that by economy I might in ten years’ time save enough to enable me to put up my plate.

I won’t weary you with the account of how we bargained and negotiated. It ended in my moving into the house next Lady Day, and starting in practice on very much the same conditions as he had suggested. He came himself to live with me in the character of a resident patient. His heart was weak, it appears, and he needed constant medical supervision. He turned the two best rooms on the first floor into a sitting-room and bedroom for himself. He was a man of singular habits, shunning company and very seldom going out. His life was irregular, but in one respect he was regularity itself. Every evening at the same hour he walked into the consulting-room, examined the books, put down five and threepence for every guinea that I had earned, and carried the rest off to the strong box in his own room. </p>

He spoke of some burglary which, he said, had been committed in the West End, and he appeared, I remember, to be quite unnecessarily excited about it, declaring that a day should not pass before we should add stronger bolts to our windows and doors. For a week he continued to be in a peculiar state of restlessness, peering continually out of the windows, and ceasing to take the short walk which had usually been the prelude to his dinner. From his manner it struck me that he was in mortal dread of something or somebody, but when I questioned him upon the point he became so offensive that I was compelled to drop the subject. Gradually as time passed his fears appeared to die away, and he had renewed his former habits, when a fresh event reduced him to the pitiable state of prostration in which he now lies. </p>

He had his hand under the other’s arm as they entered, and helped him to a chair with a tenderness which one would hardly have expected from his appearance. </p>

The patient and I then plunged into a discussion of his case, of which I took exhaustive notes. He was not remarkable for intelligence, and his answers were frequently obscure, which I attributed to his limited acquaintance with our language. Suddenly, however, as I sat writing he ceased to give any answer at all to my enquiries, and on my turning towards him I was shocked to see that he was sitting bolt upright in his chair, staring at me with a perfectly blank and rigid face.

My second, I fear, was rather one of professional satisfaction. I made notes of my patient’s pulse and temperature, tested the rigidity of his muscles, and examined his reflexes. There was nothing markedly abnormal in any of these conditions, which harmonised with my former experiences. I had obtained good results in such cases by the inhalation of nitrate of amyl, and the present seemed an admirable opportunity of testing its virtues. The bottle was downstairs in my laboratory, so, leaving my patient seated in his chair, I ran down to get it. There was some little delay in finding it – five minutes, let us say – and then I returned. Imagine my amazement to find the room empty and the patient gone! </p>

He waits downstairs, and runs up to show patients out when I ring the consulting-room bell. He had heard nothing, and the affair remained a complete mystery. Mr Blessington came in from his walk shortly afterwards, but I did not say anything to him upon the subject, for to tell the truth, I have got in the way of late of holding as little communication with him as possible. </p>

It was his suggestion that I should come round to you, and of course I at once saw the propriety of it, for certainly the incident is a very singular one, though he appears to completely overrate its importance.

His face was as impassive as ever, but his lids had drooped more heavily over his eyes, and his smoke had curled up more thickly from his pipe to emphasise each curious episode in the doctor’s tale. As our visitor concluded Holmes sprang up without a word, handed me my hat, picked up his own from the table, and followed Dr Trevelyan to the door. Within a quarter of an hour we had been dropped at the door of the physician’s residence in Brook Street, one of those sombre, flat-faced houses which one associates with a West End practice. A small page admitted us, and we began at once to ascend the broad, well-carpeted stair. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001125" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001125">We were conscious of a long scrutiny out of the darkness.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001127" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001127">He re-lit the stair gas as he spoke, and we saw before us a singular-looking man, whose appearance, as well as his voice, testified to his jangled nerves. He was very fat, but had apparently at some time been much fatter, so that the skin hung about his face in loose pouches, like the cheeks of a bloodhound. He was of a sickly colour, and his thin, sandy hair seemed to bristle up with the intensity of his emotion. In his hand he held a pistol, but he thrust it into his pocket as we advanced. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001128" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001128">‘Good evening, Mr Holmes,’ said he; ‘I am sure I am very much obliged to you for coming round.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001129" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001129">‘Quite so,’ said Holmes. ‘Who are these two men, Mr Blessington, and why do they wish to molest you?’</p>

But I don’t believe in bankers. I would never trust a banker, Mr Holmes. Between ourselves, what little I have is in that box, so you can understand what it means to me when unknown people force themselves into my rooms.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001134" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001134">Holmes looked at Blessington in his questioning way, and shook his head.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001135" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001135">‘I cannot possibly advise you if you try to deceive me,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001136" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001136">‘But I have told you everything.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001137" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001137">Holmes turned on his heel with a gesture of disgust. ‘Good night, Dr Trevelyan,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001138" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001138">‘And no advice for me?’ cried Blessington, in a breaking voice.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001139" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001139">‘My advice to you, sir, is to speak the truth.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001140" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001140">A minute later we were in the street and walking for home. We had crossed Oxford Street, and were half-way down Harley Street before I could get a word from my companion. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001141" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001141">‘Sorry to bring you out on such a fool’s errand, Watson,’ he said, at last. ‘It is an interesting case, too, at the bottom of it.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001142" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001142">‘I can make little of it,’ I confessed.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001143" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001143">‘Well, it is quite evident that there are two men – more, perhaps, but at least two – who are determined for some reason to get at this fellow Blessington. I have no doubt in my mind that both on the first and on the second occasion that young man penetrated to Blessington’s room, while his confederate, by an ingenious device, kept the doctor from interfering.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter009-p203" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter009-p203">‘And the catalepsy!’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001144" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001144">‘A fraudulent imitation, Watson, though I should hardly dare to hint as much to our specialist. It is a very easy complaint to imitate. I have done it myself.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001145" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001145">‘And then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001146" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001146">‘By the purest chance Blessington was out on each occasion. Their reason for choosing so unusual an hour for a consultation was obviously to ensure that there should be no other patient in the waiting-room. It just happened, however, that this hour coincided with Blessington’s constitutional, which seems to show that they were not very well acquainted with his daily routine. Of course, if they had been merely after plunder they would at least have made some attempt to search for it. Besides, I can read in a man’s eye when it is his own skin that he is frightened for. It is inconceivable that this fellow could have made two such vindictive enemies as these appear to be without knowing of it. I hold it, therefore, to be certain that he does know who these men are, and that for reasons of his own he suppresses it. It is just possible that tomorrow may find him in a more communicative mood.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001147" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001147">‘Is there not one alternative,’ I suggested, ‘grotesquely improbable, no doubt, but still just conceivable? Might the whole story of the cataleptic Russian and his son be a concoction of Dr Trevelyan’s, who has, for his own purposes, been in Blessington’s rooms?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001148" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001148">I saw in the gaslight that Holmes wore an amused smile at this brilliant departure of mine.</p>
        <p id="chapter009-p204" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter009-p204">‘My dear fellow,’ said he, ‘it was one of the first solutions which occurred to me, but I was soon able to corroborate the doctor’s tale. This young man has left prints upon the stair carpet which made it quite superfluous for me to ask to see those which he had made in the room. When I tell you that his shoes were square-toed, instead of being pointed like Blessington’s, and were quite an inch and a third longer than the doctor’s, you will acknowledge that there can be no doubt as to his individuality. But we may sleep on it now, for I shall be surprised if we do not hear something further from Brook Street in the morning.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001149" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001149">Sherlock Holmes’s prophecy was soon fulfilled, and in a dramatic fashion. At half-past seven next morning, in the first dim glimmer of daylight, I found him standing by my bedside in his dressing-gown. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001150" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001150">‘There’s a brougham waiting for us, Watson,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001151" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001151">‘What’s the matter, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001152" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001152">‘The Brook Street business.’</p>

Our friend the doctor was hard put to it when he wrote this. Come along, my dear fellow, for it’s an urgent call.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001155" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001155">In a quarter of an hour or so we were back at the physician’s house. He came running out to meet us with a face of horror.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001156" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001156">‘Oh, such a business!’ he cried, with his hands to his temples.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001157" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001157">‘What, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001158" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001158">‘Blessington has committed suicide!’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001159" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001159">Holmes whistled.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001160" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001160">‘Yes, he hanged himself during the night!’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001161" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001161">We had entered, and the doctor had preceded us into what was evidently his waiting-room.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001162" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001162">‘I really hardly know what I am doing,’ he cried. ‘The police are already upstairs. It has shaken me most dreadfully.’</p>
        <p id="chapter009-p205" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#chapter009-p205">‘When did you find it out?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001163" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001163">‘He has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning. When the maid entered about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging in the middle of the room. He had tied his cord to the hook on which the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of the very box that he showed us yesterday.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001164" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00003.smil#p_001164">Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001165" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001165">‘With your permission,’ said he at last, ‘I should like to go upstairs and look into the matter.’ We both ascended, followed by the doctor. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001166" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001166">It was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom door. I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man Blessington conveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance. The neck was drawn out like a plucked chicken’s, making the rest of him seem the more obese and unnatural by the contrast. He was clad only in his long night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded starkly from beneath it. Beside him stood a smart-looking police inspector, who was taking notes in a pocket-book. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001167" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001167">‘Ah, Mr Holmes,’ said he, as my friend entered. ‘I am delighted to see you.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001168" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001168">‘Good morning, Lanner,’ answered Holmes. ‘You won’t think me an intruder, I am sure. Have you heard of the events which led up to this affair?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001169" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001169">‘Yes, I heard something of them.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001170" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001170">‘Have you formed any opinion?’</p>
        <p id="chapter009-p206" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter009-p206">‘As far as I can see, the man has been driven out of his senses by fright. The bed has been well slept in, you see. There’s his impression deep enough. It’s about five in the morning, you know, that suicides are most common. That would be about his time for hanging himself. It seems to have been a very deliberate affair.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001171" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001171">‘I should say that he has been dead about three hours, judging by the rigidity of the muscles,’ said I.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001172" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001172">‘Noticed anything peculiar about the room?’ asked Holmes.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001173" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001173">‘Found a screwdriver and some screws on the wash-hand stand. Seems to have smoked heavily during the night, too. Here are four cigar ends that I picked out of the fireplace.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001174" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001174">‘Hum!’ said Holmes. ‘Have you got his cigar-holder?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001175" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001175">‘No, I have seen none.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001176" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001176">‘His cigar-case, then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001177" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001177">‘Yes, it was in his coat pocket.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001178" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001178">Holmes opened it and smelled the single cigar which it contained.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001179" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001179">‘Oh, this is a Havana, and these others are cigars of the peculiar sort which are imported by the Dutch from their East Indian Colonies. They are usually wrapped in straw, you know, and are thinner for their length than any other brand.’ He picked up the four ends and examined them with his pocket lens. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001180" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001180">‘Two of these have been smoked from a holder and two without,’ said he. ‘Two have been cut by a not very sharp knife, and two have had the ends bitten off by a set of excellent teeth. This is no suicide, Mr Lanner. It is a very deeply planned and cold-blooded murder.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001181" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001181">‘Impossible!’ cried the inspector.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001182" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001182">‘And why?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001183" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001183">‘Why should anyone murder a man in so clumsy a fashion as by hanging him?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001184" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001184">‘That is what we have to find out.’</p>
        <p id="chapter009-p207" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter009-p207">‘How could they get in?’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001186" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001186">‘It was barred in the morning.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001187" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001187">‘Then it was barred after them.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001188" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001188">‘How do you know?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001189" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001189">‘I saw their traces. Excuse me a moment, and I may be able to give you some further information about it.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001190" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001190">He went over to the door, and turning the lock he examined it in his methodical fashion. Then he took out the key, which was on the inside, and inspected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs, the mantelpiece, the dead body and the rope were each in turn examined, until at last he professed himself satisfied, and with my aid and that of the inspector cut down the wretched object, and laid it reverently under a sheet. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001191" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001191">‘How about this rope?’ he asked.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001192" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001192">‘It is cut off this,’ said Dr Trevelyan, drawing a large coil from under the bed. ‘He was morbidly nervous of fire, and always kept this beside him, so that he might escape by the window in case the stairs were burning.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001193" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001193">‘That must have saved them trouble,’ said Holmes thoughtfully. ‘Yes, the actual facts are very plain, and I shall be surprised if by the afternoon I cannot give you the reasons for them as well. I will take this photograph of Blessington which I see upon the mantelpiece, as it may help me in my enquiries.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001194" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001194">‘But you have told us nothing,’ cried the doctor.</p>
        <p id="chapter009-p208" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter009-p208">‘Oh, there can be no doubt as to the sequence of events,’ said Holmes. ‘There were three of them in it: the young man, the old man, and a third to whose identity I have no clue. The first two, I need hardly remark, are the same who masqueraded as the Russian count and his son, so we can give a very full description of them. They were admitted by a confederate inside the house. If I might offer you a word of advice, Inspector, it would be to arrest the page, who, as I understand, has only recently come into your service, Doctor.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001195" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001195">‘The young imp cannot be found,’ said Dr Trevelyan; ‘the maid and the cook have just been searching for him.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001196" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001196">Holmes shrugged his shoulders.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001197" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001197">‘He has played a not unimportant part in this drama,’ said he. ‘The three men having ascended the stair, which they did on tiptoe, the elder man first, the younger man second, and the unknown man in the rear—’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001198" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001198">‘My dear Holmes!’ I ejaculated.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001199" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001199">‘Oh, there could be no question as to the superimposing of the footmarks. I had the advantage of learning which was which last night. They ascended then to Mr Blessington’s room, the door of which they found to be locked. With the help of a wire, however, they forced round the key. Even without the lens, you will perceive, by the scratches on this ward, where the pressure was applied. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001200" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001200">‘On entering the room, their first proceeding must have been to gag Mr Blessington. He may have been asleep, or he may have been so paralysed with terror as to have been unable to cry out. These walls are thick, and it is conceivable that his shriek, if he had time to utter one, was unheard. </p>
        <p id="chapter009-p209" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter009-p209">‘Having secured him, it is evident to me that a consultation of some sort was held. Probably it was something in the nature of a judicial proceeding. It must have lasted for some time, for it was then that these cigars were smoked. The older man sat in that wicker chair: it was he who used the cigar-holder. The younger man sat over yonder; he knocked his ash off against the chest of drawers. The third fellow paced up and down. Blessington, I think, sat upright in the bed, but of that I cannot be absolutely certain. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001201" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001201">‘Well, it ended by their taking Blessington and hanging him. The matter was so pre-arranged that it is my belief that they brought with them some sort of block or pulley which might serve as a gallows. That screwdriver and those screws were, as I conceive, for fixing it up. Seeing the hook, however, they naturally saved themselves the trouble. Having finished their work they made off, and the door was barred behind them by their confederate.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001202" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001202">We had all listened with the deepest interest to this sketch of the night’s doings, which Holmes had deduced from signs so subtle and minute that, even when he had pointed them out to us, we could scarcely follow him in his reasonings. The inspector hurried away on the instant to make enquiries about the page, while Holmes and I returned to Baker Street for breakfast. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001203" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001203">‘I’ll be back by three,’ said he when we had finished our meal. ‘Both the inspector and the doctor will meet me here at that hour, and I hope by that time to have cleared up any little obscurity which the case may still present.’ </p>

Tobin, the caretaker, was murdered, and the thieves got away with seven thousand pounds. This was in 1875. They were all five arrested, but the evidence against them was by no means conclusive. This Blessington or Sutton, who was the worst of the gang, turned informer. On his evidence Cartwright was hanged, and the other three got fifteen years apiece. When they got out the other day, which was some years before their full term, they set themselves, as you perceive, to hunt down the traitor and to avenge the death of their comrade upon him. Twice they tried to get at him and failed; a third time, you see, it came off. Is there anything further which I can explain, Dr Trevelyan?’ </p>

This reticence upon his part had increased the somewhat inhuman effect which he produced upon me, until sometimes I found myself regarding him as an isolated phenomenon, a brain without a heart, as deficient in human sympathy as he was pre-eminent in intelligence. His aversion to women, and his disinclination to form new friendships, were both typical of his unemotional character, but not more so than his complete suppression of every reference to his own people. I had come to believe that he was an orphan with no relatives living, but one day, to my very great surprise, he began to talk to me about his brother. </span></p>

But, none the less, my turn that way is in my veins, and may have come with my grandmother, who was the sister of Vernet, the French artist.

He would not even go out of his way to verify his own solutions, and would rather be considered wrong than take the trouble to prove himself right. Again and again I have taken a problem to him, and have received an explanation which has afterwards proved to be the correct one.

From year’s end to year’s end he takes no other exercise, and is seen nowhere else, except only in the Diogenes Club, which is just opposite his rooms.’ </p>

There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubbable men in town. No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. Save in the Strangers’ Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, permitted, and three offences, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001241" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001241">We had reached Pall Mall as we talked, and were walking down it from the St James’s end. Sherlock Holmes stopped at a door some little distance from the Carlton, and, cautioning me not to speak, he led the way into the hall. Through the glass panelling I caught a glimpse of a large and luxurious room in which a considerable number of men were sitting about and reading papers, each in his own little nook. Holmes showed me into a small chamber which looked out on to Pall Mall, and then, leaving me for a minute, he came back with a companion who I knew could only be his brother. </p>
        <p id="chapter010-p217" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter010-p217">Mycroft Holmes was a much larger and stouter man than Sherlock. His body was absolutely corpulent, but his face, though massive, had preserved something of the sharpness of expression which was so remarkable in that of his brother. His eyes, which were of a peculiarly light watery grey, seemed to always retain that far-away, introspective look which I had only observed in Sherlock’s when he was exerting his full powers. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001242" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001242">‘I am glad to meet you, sir,’ said he, putting out a broad, flat hand, like the flipper of a seal. ‘I hear of Sherlock everywhere since you became his chronicler.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001247" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001247">‘The billiard-marker and the other?’</p>

He earns his living partly as interpreter in the law courts, partly by acting as guide to any wealthy Orientals who may visit the Northumberland Avenue hotels.

I am an interpreter, as, perhaps, my neighbour there has told you. I interpret all languages – or nearly all – but as I am a Greek by birth, and with a Grecian name, it is with that particular tongue that I am principally associated. For many years I have been the chief Greek interpreter in London, and my name is very well known in the hotels. </p>

I was not surprised, therefore, on Monday night when a Mr Latimer, a very fashionably dressed young man, came up to my rooms and asked me to accompany him in a cab, which was waiting at the door. A Greek friend had come to see him upon business, he said, and, as he could speak nothing but his own tongue, the services of an interpreter were indispensable. He gave me to understand that his house was some little distance off, in Kensington, and he seemed to be in a great hurry, bustling me rapidly into the cab when we had descended into the street. </p>

It was certainly more roomy than the ordinary four-wheeled disgrace to London, and the fittings, though frayed, were of rich quality. Mr Latimer seated himself opposite to me, and we started off through Charing Cross and up the Shaftesbury Avenue. We had come out upon Oxford Street, and I had ventured some remark as to this being a roundabout way to Kensington, when my words were arrested by the extraordinary conduct of my companion. </p>

Then he placed it, without a word, upon the seat beside him.

He imprudently puts himself into the power of the young man and his older associate. They seize him and use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to make over the girl’s fortune – of which he may be trustee – to them. This he refuses to do. In order to negotiate with him, they have to get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr Melas, having used some other one before. The girl is not told of the arrival of her brother, and finds it out by the merest accident.’ </p>

That must be our main hope, for the brother, of course, is a complete stranger. It is clear that some time has elapsed since this Harold established these relations with the girl – some weeks at any rate – since the brother in Greece has had time to hear of it, and come across. If they have been living in the same place during this time, it is probable that we shall have some answer to Mycroft’s advertisement.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001349" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001349">‘Here it is,’ said he, ‘written with a J pen on royal cream paper by a middle-aged man with a weak constitution. “Sir,” he says, “in answer to your advertisement of today’s date, I beg to inform you that I know the young lady in question very well. If you should care to call upon me, I could give you some particulars as to her painful history. She is living at present at The Myrtles, Beckenham. – Yours faithfully, J. Davenport.” </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001351" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001351">‘My dear Mycroft, the brother’s life is more valuable than the sister’s story. I think we should call at Scotland Yard for Inspector Gregson, and go straight out to Beckenham. We know that a man is being done to death, and every hour may be vital.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001352" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001352">‘Better pick up Mr Melas upon our way,’ I suggested; ‘we may need an interpreter.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001353" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001353">‘Excellent!’ said Sherlock Holmes. ‘Send the boy for a four-wheeler, and we shall be off at once.’ He opened the table-drawer as he spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket. ‘Yes,’ said he, in answer to my glance, ‘I should say from what we have heard that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001354" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001354">It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall, at the rooms of Mr Melas. A gentleman had just called for him, and he was gone. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001360" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001360">‘Come along!’ cried Sherlock Holmes abruptly. ‘This grows serious!’ he observed, as we drove to Scotland Yard. ‘These men have got hold of Melas again. He is a man of no physical courage, as they are well aware from their experience the other night. This villain was able to terrorise him the instant that he got into his presence. No doubt they want his professional services; but, having used him, they may be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his treachery.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001361" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001361">Our hope was that by taking the train we might get to Beckenham as soon as, or sooner than, the carriage. On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the house. It was a quarter to ten before we reached London Bridge, and half-past before the four of us alighted on the Beckenham platform. A drive of half a mile brought us to The Myrtles – a large, dark house, standing back from the road in its own grounds. Here we dismissed our cab, and made our way up the drive together. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001362" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001362">‘The windows are all dark,’ remarked the inspector. ‘The house seems deserted.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001365" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001365">The inspector laughed. ‘I saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001366" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001366">‘You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper – so much so that we can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on the carriage.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001367" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001367">‘You get a trifle beyond me there,’ said the inspector, shrugging his shoulders. ‘It will not be an easy door to force. But we will try if we cannot make someone hear us.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001368" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001368">He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but without any success. Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few minutes. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001369" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001369">‘I have a window open,’ said he.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001370" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001370">‘It is a mercy that you are on the side of the Force, and not against it, Mr Holmes,’ remarked the inspector, as he noted the clever way in which my friend had forced back the catch. ‘Well, I think that, under the circumstances, we may enter without waiting for an invitation.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001371" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001371">One after the other we made our way into a large apartment, which was evidently that in which Mr Melas had found himself. The inspector had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see the two doors, the curtain, the lamp and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them. On the table stood two glasses, an empty brandy bottle, and the remains of a meal. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001372" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001372">‘What is that?’ asked Holmes suddenly.</p>
        <p id="chapter010-p233" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter010-p233">We all stood still and listened. A low, moaning sound was coming from somewhere above our heads. Holmes rushed to the door and out into the hall. The dismal noise came from upstairs. He dashed up, the inspector and I at his heels, while his brother, Mycroft, followed as quickly as his great bulk would permit. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001373" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001373">Three doors faced us upon the second floor, and it was from the central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. It was locked, but the key was on the outside. Holmes flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in an instant with his hand to his throat. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001374" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001374">‘It’s charcoal!’ he cried. ‘Give it time. It will clear.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001375" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001375">Peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came from a dull, blue flame, which flickered from a small brass tripod in the centre. It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor, while in the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures, which crouched against the wall. From the open door there reeked a horrible, poisonous exhalation, which set us gasping and coughing. Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and then, dashing into the room, he threw up the window and hurled the brazen tripod out into the garden. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001376" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001376">‘We can enter in a minute,’ he gasped, darting out again. ‘Where is a candle? I doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere. Hold the light at the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft. Now!’ </p>
        <p id="chapter010-p234" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter010-p234">With a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out on to the landing. Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes. Indeed, so distorted were their features that, save for his black beard and stout figure, we might have failed to recognise in one of them the Greek interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours before at the Diogenes Club. His hands and feet were securely strapped together and he bore over one eye the mark of a violent blow. The other, who was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage of emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a grotesque pattern over his face. He had ceased to moan as we laid him down, and a glance showed me that for him, at least, our aid had come too late. Mr Melas, however, still lived, and in less than an hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy, I had the satisfaction of seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him back from the dark valley in which all paths meet. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001377" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001377">It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but confirm our own deductions. His visitor on entering his rooms had drawn a life preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped him for the second time. Indeed, it was almost mesmeric the effect which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and a blanched cheek. He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than the first, in which the two Englishmen had menaced their prisoner with instant death if he did not comply with their demands. Finally, finding him proof against every threat, they hurled him back into his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which appeared from the newspaper advertisements, they had stunned him with a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us bending over him. </p>
        <p id="chapter010-p235" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter010-p235">And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter, the explanation of which is still involved in some mystery. We were able to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy Grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in England. While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer, who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded her to fly with him. Her friends, shocked at the event, had contented themselves with informing her brother at Athens, and had then washed their hands of the matter. The brother, on his arrival in England, had imprudently placed himself in the power of Latimer and of his associate, whose name was Wilson Kemp – a man of the foulest antecedents. These two, finding that through his ignorance of the language he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a prisoner, and had endeavoured, by cruelty and starvation, to make him sign away his own and his sister’s property. They had kept him in the house without the girl’s knowledge, and the plaster over the face had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she should ever catch a glimpse of him. Her feminine perceptions, however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the occasion of the interpreter’s first visit, she had seen him for the first time. The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators. Finding that their secret was out and that their prisoner was not to be coerced, the two villains, with the girl, had fled away at a few hours’ notice from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they thought, taken vengeance upon both the man who had defied and the one who had betrayed them. </p>
        <p id="chapter010-p236" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter010-p236">Months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from Budapest. It told how two Englishmen who had been travelling with a woman had met with a tragic end. They had each been stabbed, it seems, and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had quarrelled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other. Holmes, however, is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking, and he holds to this day that if one could find the Grecian girl one might learn how the wrongs of herself and her brother came to be avenged. </p>

I find them recorded in my notes under the headings of ‘The Adventure of the Second Stain’, ‘The Adventure of the Naval Treaty’, and ‘The Adventure of the Tired Captain’. The first of these, however, deals with interests of such importance, and implicates so many of the first families in the kingdom, that for many years it will be impossible to make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was ever engaged has illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubuque, of the Paris Police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of Danzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to be side issues. The new century will have come, however, before the story can be safely told. Meanwhile, I pass on to the second upon my list, which promised also, at one time, to be of national importance, and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique character. </span></p>

He was a very brilliant boy, and carried away every prize which the school had to offer, finishing his exploits by winning a scholarship, which sent him on to continue his triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I remember, extremely well connected, and even when we were all little boys together we knew that his mother’s brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great Conservative politician. This gaudy relationship did him little good at school; on the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it was another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely that his abilities and the influence which he commanded had won him a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence: </p>

        <p id="chapter011-p240" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p240">Holmes was seated at his side-table clad in his dressing-gown and working hard over a chemical investigation. A large curved retort was boiling furiously in the bluish flame of a Bunsen burner, and the distilled drops were condensing into a two-litre measure. My friend hardly glanced up as I entered, and I, seeing that his investigation must be of importance, seated myself in an armchair and waited. He dipped into this bottle or that, drawing out a few drops of each with his glass pipette, and finally brought a test-tube containing a solution over to the table. In his right hand he had a slip of litmus-paper. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001384" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001384">‘You come at a crisis, Watson,’ said he. ‘If this paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.’ He dipped it into the test-tube and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson. ‘Hum! I thought as much!’ he cried. ‘I shall be at your service in one instant, Watson. You will find tobacco in the Persian slipper.’ He turned to his desk and scribbled off several telegrams, which were handed over to the page-boy. Then he threw himself down in the chair opposite, and drew up his knees until his fingers clasped round his long, thin shins. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001385" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001385">‘A very commonplace little murder,’ said he. ‘You’ve got something better, I fancy. You are the stormy petrel of crime, Watson. What is it?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001386" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001386">I handed him the letter, which he read with the most concentrated attention.</p>

        <p id="chapter011-p241" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p241">‘No, a woman’s; and a woman of rare character. You see, at the commencement of an investigation, it is something to know that your client is in close contact with someone who for good or evil has an exceptional nature. My interest is already awakened in the case. If you are ready, we will start at once for Woking and see this diplomatist who is in such evil case, and the lady to whom he dictates his letters.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001393" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001393">We were fortunate enough to catch an early train at Waterloo, and in a little under an hour we found ourselves among the firwoods and the heather of Woking. Briarbrae proved to be a large detached house standing in extensive grounds, within a few minutes’ walk of the station. On sending in our cards we were shown into an elegantly appointed drawing-room, where we were joined in a few minutes by a rather stout man, who received us with much hospitality. His age may have been nearer forty than thirty, but his cheeks were so ruddy, and his eyes so merry, that he still conveyed the impression of a plump and mischievous boy. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001394" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001394">‘I am so glad that you have come,’ said he, shaking our hands with effusion. ‘Percy has been enquiring for you all the morning. Ah, poor old chap, he clings to any straw. His father and mother asked me to see you, for the mere mention of the subject is very painful to them.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001395" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001395">‘We have had no details yet,’ observed Holmes. ‘I perceive that you are not yourself a member of the family.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001396" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001396">Our acquaintance looked surprised, and then, glancing down, he began to laugh.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001397" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001397">‘Of course you saw the “J.H.” monogram on my locket,’ said he. ‘For a moment I thought you had done something clever. Joseph Harrison is my name, and as Percy is to marry my sister Annie, I shall at least be a relation by marriage. You will find my sister in his room, for she has nursed him hand and foot these two months back. Perhaps we had better go in at once, for I know how impatient he is.’ </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p242" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p242">The chamber into which we were shown was on the same floor as the drawing-room. It was furnished partly as a sitting-room and partly as a bedroom, with flowers arranged daintily in every nook and corner. A young man, very pale and worn, was lying upon a sofa near the open window, through which came the rich scent of the garden and the balmy summer air. A woman was sitting beside him, and rose as we entered. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001398" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001398">‘Shall I leave, Percy?’ she asked.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001399" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001399">He clutched her hand to detain her. ‘How are you, Watson?’ said he cordially. ‘I should never have known you under that moustache, and I dare say you would not be prepared to swear to me. This, I presume, is your celebrated friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001400" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001400">I introduced him in a few words, and we both sat down. The stout young man had left us, but his sister still remained, with her hand in that of the invalid. She was a striking-looking woman, a little short and thick for symmetry, but with a beautiful olive complexion, large, dark Italian eyes, and a wealth of deep black hair. Her rich tints made the white face of her companion the more worn and haggard by the contrast. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001401" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001401">‘I won’t waste your time,’ said he, raising himself upon the sofa. ‘I’ll plunge into the matter without further preamble. I was a happy and successful man, Mr Holmes, and on the eve of being married, when a sudden and dreadful misfortune wrecked all my prospects in life. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001402" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001402">‘I was, as Watson may have told you, in the Foreign Office, and through the influence of my uncle, Lord Holdhurst, I rose rapidly to a responsible position. When my uncle became Foreign Minister in this Administration he gave me several missions of trust, and as I always brought them to a successful conclusion, he came at last to have the utmost confidence in my ability and tact. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p243" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p243">‘Nearly ten weeks ago – to be more accurate, on the 23rd of May – he called me into his private room and, after complimenting me upon the good work which I had done, informed me that he had a new commission of trust for me to execute. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001403" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001403">‘“This”, said he, taking a grey roll of paper from his bureau, “is the original of that secret treaty between England and Italy, of which, I regret to say, some rumours have already got into the public Press. It is of enormous importance that nothing further should leak out. The French or Russian Embassies would pay an immense sum to learn the contents of these papers. They should not leave my bureau were it not that it is absolutely necessary to have them copied. You have a desk in your office?” </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001404" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001404">‘“Yes, sir.”</p>

One of them in my room, Charles Gorot, had some arrears of work to make up, so I left him there and went out to dine. When I returned he was gone. I was anxious to hurry my work, for I knew that Joseph, the Mr Harrison whom you saw just now, was in town, and that he would travel down to Woking by the eleven o’clock train, and I wanted if possible to catch it. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001416" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001416">‘When I came to examine the treaty I saw at once that it was of such importance that my uncle had been guilty of no exaggeration in what he had said. Without going into details, I may say that it defined the position of Great Britain towards the Triple Alliance, and foreshadowed the policy which this country would pursue in the event of the French fleet gaining a complete ascendancy over that of Italy in the Mediterranean. The questions treated in it were purely naval. At the end were the signatures of the high dignitaries who had signed it. I glanced my eyes over it, and then settled down to my task of copying. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001417" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001417">‘It was a long document, written in the French language, and containing twenty-six separate articles. I copied as quickly as I could, but at nine o’clock I had only done nine articles, and it seemed hopeless for me to attempt to catch my train. I was feeling drowsy and stupid, partly from my dinner and also from the effects of a long day’s work. A cup of coffee would clear my brain. A commissionaire remains all night in a little lodge at the foot of the stairs, and is in the habit of making coffee at his spirit-lamp for any of the officials who may be working overtime. I rang the bell, therefore, to summon him. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p245" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p245">‘To my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons, a large, coarse-faced, elderly woman, in an apron.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001418" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001418">‘I wrote two more articles, and then, feeling more drowsy than ever, I rose and walked up and down the room to stretch my legs. My coffee had not yet come, and I wondered what the cause of the delay could be. Opening the door, I started down the corridor to find out. There was a straight passage dimly lit which led from the room in which I had been working, and was the only exit from it. It ended in a curving staircase, with the commissionaire’s lodge in the passage at the bottom. Half-way down this staircase is a small landing, with another passage running into it at right angles. The second one leads, by means of a second small stair, to a side door used by servants, and also as a short cut by clerks when coming from Charles Street. </p>

Forbes flung open the door, and we both ran into the back room or kitchen, but the woman had got there before us.

There were no signs, however, of any ashes or scraps. When we reached Scotland Yard she was handed over at once to the female searcher. I waited in an agony of suspense until she came back with her report. There were no signs of the papers. </p>

Hitherto I had been acting, and action had numbed thought. I had been so confident of regaining the treaty at once that I had not dared to think of what would be the consequence if I failed to do so. But now there was nothing more to be done, and I had leisure to realise my position. It was horrible! Watson there would tell you that I was a nervous, sensitive boy at school. It is my nature. I thought of my uncle and of his colleagues in the Cabinet, of the shame which I had brought upon him, upon myself, upon everyone connected with me. What though I was the victim of an extraordinary accident? No allowance is made for accidents where diplomatic interests are at stake. I was ruined; shamefully, hopelessly ruined. I don’t know what I did. I fancy I must have made a scene. I have a dim recollection of a group of officials who crowded round me endeavouring to soothe me. One of them drove down with me to Waterloo and saw me into the Woking train. I believe that he would have come all the way had it not been that Dr Ferrier, who lives near me, was going down by that very train. The doctor most kindly took charge of me, and it was well he did so, for I had a fit in the station, and before we reached home I was practically a raving maniac. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p253" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#chapter011-p253">‘You can imagine the state of things here when they were roused from their beds by the doctor’s ringing, and found me in this condition. Poor Annie here and my mother were broken-hearted. Dr Ferrier had just heard enough from the detective at the station to be able to give an idea of what had happened, and his story did not mend matters. It was evident to all that I was in for a long illness, so Joseph was bundled out of this cheery bedroom, and it was turned into a sickroom for me. Here I have lain, Mr Holmes, for over nine weeks, unconscious, and raving with brain fever. If it had not been for Miss Harrison here and for the doctor’s care I should not be speaking to you now. She has nursed me by day, and a hired nurse has looked after me by night, for in my mad fits I was capable of anything. Slowly my reason has cleared, but it is only during the last three days that my memory has quite returned. Sometimes I wish that it never had. The first thing I did was to wire to Mr Forbes, who had the case in hand. He came out and assured me that, though everything has been done, no trace of a clue has been discovered. The commissionaire and his wife have been examined in every way without any light being thrown upon the matter. The suspicions of the police then rested upon young Gorot, who, as you may remember, stayed overtime in the office that night. His remaining behind and his French name were really the only two points which could suggest suspicion; but as a matter of fact, I did not begin work until he had gone, and his people are of Huguenot extraction, but as English in sympathy and tradition as you and I are. Nothing was found to implicate him in any way, and there the matter dropped. I turn to you, Mr Holmes, as absolutely my last hope. If you fail me, then my honour as well as my position are for ever forfeited.’ </p>

Our highest assurance of the goodness of Providence seems to me to rest in the flowers. All other things, our powers, our desires, our food, are really necessary for our existence in the first instance. But this rose is an extra. Its smell and its colour are an embellishment of life, not a condition of it. It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.’ </p>

If he came from outside on so wet a night, and yet left no trace of damp upon the linoleum, which was examined within a few minutes of his passing, then it is exceedingly probable that he came in a cab. Yes, I think that we may safely deduce a cab.’ </p>

Or was it someone who was with the thief who did it in order to prevent the crime? Or was it an accident? Or was it—?’ He sank back into the state of intense and silent thought from which he had emerged, but it seemed to me, accustomed as I was to his every mood, that some new possibility had dawned suddenly upon him. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001530" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001530">It was twenty past three when we reached our terminus, and after a hasty luncheon at the buffet we pushed on at once to Scotland Yard. Holmes had already wired to Forbes, and we found him waiting to receive us: a small, foxy man, with a sharp but by no means amiable expression. He was decidedly frigid in his manner to us, especially when he heard the errand upon which we had come. </p>

There is nothing against them, then, but the woman’s character. Did you ask her why she hurried away that night? Her haste attracted the attention of the police-constable.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001544" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001544">‘She was later than usual, and wanted to get home.’</p>

The statesman received us with that old-fashioned courtesy for which he is remarkable, and seated us on the two luxurious easy chairs on either side of the fireplace. Standing on the rug between us, with his slight, tall figure, his sharp-featured, thoughtful face, and his curling hair prematurely tinged with grey, he seemed to represent that not too common type, a nobleman who is in truth noble. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001559" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001559">‘Your name is very familiar to me, Mr Holmes,’ said he, smiling. ‘And of course I cannot pretend to be ignorant of the object of your visit.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001575" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001575">Holmes considered for a moment. ‘There is another very important point which I wish to discuss with you,’ said he. ‘You feared, as I understand, that very grave results might follow from the details of this treaty becoming known?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001576" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00004.smil#p_001576">A shadow passed over the expressive face of the statesman. ‘Very grave results, indeed.’</p>

He is far from rich, and has many calls. You noticed, of course, that his boots had been resoled? Now, Watson, I won’t detain you from your legitimate work any longer. I shall do nothing more today unless I have an answer to my cab advertisement.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001590" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001590">I met him accordingly next morning, and we travelled down to Woking together. He had had no answer to his advertisement, he said, and no fresh light had been thrown upon the case. He had, when he so willed it, the utter immobility of countenance of a Red Indian, and I could not gather from his appearance whether he was satisfied or not with the position of the case. His conversation, I remember, was about the Bertillon system of measurements, and he expressed his enthusiastic admiration of the French savant. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001591" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001591">We found our client still under the charge of his devoted nurse, but looking considerably better than before. He rose from the sofa and greeted us without difficulty when we entered. </p>

I was so much better that I thought I could dispense with one. I had a nightlight burning, however. Well, about two in the morning I had sunk into a light sleep, when I was suddenly aroused by a slight noise. It was like the sound which a mouse makes when it is gnawing a plank, and I lay listening to it for some time under the impression that it must come from that cause. Then it grew louder, and suddenly there came from the window a sharp metallic snick. I sat up in amazement. There could be no doubt what the sounds were now. The faint ones had been caused by someone forcing an instrument through the slit between the sashes, and the second by the catch being pressed back. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p265" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p265">‘There was a pause then for about ten minutes, as if the person were waiting to see whether the noise had awoken me. Then I heard a gentle creaking as the window was very slowly opened. I could stand it no longer, for my nerves are not what they used to be. I sprang out of bed and flung open the shutters. A man was crouching at the window. I could see little of him, for he was gone like a flash. He was wrapped in some sort of cloak, which came across the lower part of his face. One thing only I am sure of, and that is that he had some weapon in his hand. It looked to me like a long knife. I distinctly saw the gleam of it as he turned to run.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001603" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001603">‘This is most interesting,’ said Holmes. ‘Pray, what did you do then?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001604" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001604">‘I should have followed him through the open window if I had been stronger. As it was, I rang the bell and roused the house. It took me some little time, for the bell rings in the kitchen, and the servants all sleep upstairs. I shouted, however, and that brought Joseph down, and he roused the others. Joseph and the groom found marks on the flower-bed outside the window, but the weather has been so dry lately that they found it hopeless to follow the trail across the grass. There’s a place, however, on the wooden fence which skirts the road which shows signs, they tell me, as if someone had got over and had snapped the top of the rail in doing so. I have said nothing to the local police yet, for I thought I had best have your opinion first.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001605" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001605">This tale of our client’s appeared to have an extraordinary effect upon Sherlock Holmes. He rose from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable excitement. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001606" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001606">‘Misfortunes never come singly,’ said Phelps, smiling, though it was evident that his adventure had somewhat shaken him.</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p266" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p266">‘You have certainly had your share,’ said Holmes. ‘Do you think you could walk round the house with me?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001607" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001607">‘Oh, yes, I should like a little sunshine. Joseph will come too.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001608" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001608">‘And I also,’ said Miss Harrison.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001609" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001609">‘I am afraid not,’ said Holmes, shaking his head. ‘I think I must ask you to remain sitting exactly where you are.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001610" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001610">The young lady resumed her seat with an air of displeasure. Her brother, however, had joined us, and we set off all four together. We passed round the lawn to the outside of the young diplomatist’s window. There were, as he had said, marks upon the flower-bed, but they were hopelessly blurred and vague. Holmes stooped over them for an instant, and then rose, shrugging his shoulders. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001611" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001611">‘I don’t think anyone could make much of this,’ said he. ‘Let us go round the house and see why this particular room was chosen by the burglar. I should have thought those larger windows of the drawing-room and dining-room would have had more attractions for him.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001612" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001612">‘They are more visible from the road,’ suggested Mr Joseph Harrison.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001613" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001613">‘Ah, yes, of course. There is a door here which he might have attempted. What is it for?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001614" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001614">‘It is the side entrance for tradespeople. Of course, it is locked at night.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001615" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001615">‘Have you ever had an alarm like this before?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001616" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001616">‘Never,’ said our client.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001617" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001617">‘Do you keep plate in the house, or anything to attract burglars?’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001619" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001619">Holmes strolled round the house with his hands in his pockets, and a negligent air which was unusual with him.</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p267" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p267">‘By the way,’ said he to Joseph Harrison, ‘you found some place, I understand, where the fellow scaled the fence. Let us have a look at that.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001620" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001620">The young man led us to a spot where the top of one of the wooden rails had been cracked. A small fragment of the wood was hanging down. Holmes pulled it off and examined it critically. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001621" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001621">‘Do you think that was done last night? It looks rather old, does it not?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001622" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001622">‘Well, possibly so.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001623" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001623">‘There are no marks of anyone jumping down upon the other side. No, I fancy we shall get no help here. Let us go back to the bedroom and talk the matter over.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001624" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001624">Percy Phelps was walking very slowly, leaning upon the arm of his future brother-in-law. Holmes walked swiftly across the lawn, and we were at the open window of the bedroom long before the others came up. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001625" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001625">‘Miss Harrison,’ said Holmes, speaking with the utmost intensity of manner, ‘you must stay where you are all day. Let nothing prevent you from staying where you are all day. It is of most vital importance.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001626" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001626">‘Certainly, if you wish it, Mr Holmes,’ said the girl, in astonishment.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001627" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001627">‘When you go to bed lock the door of this room on the outside and keep the key. Promise to do this.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001628" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001628">‘But, Percy?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001629" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001629">‘He will come to London with us.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001630" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001630">‘And I am to remain here?’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001632" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001632">She gave a nod of assent just as the other two came up.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001633" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001633">‘Why do you sit moping there, Annie?’ cried her brother. ‘Come out into the sunshine!’</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p268" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p268">‘No, thank you, Joseph. I have a slight headache, and this room is deliciously cool and soothing.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001634" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001634">‘What do you propose now, Mr Holmes?’ asked our client.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001635" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001635">‘Well, in investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main enquiry. It would be a very great help to me if you could come up to London with us.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001636" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001636">‘At once?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001637" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001637">‘Well, as soon as you conveniently can. Say in an hour.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001638" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001638">‘I feel quite strong enough, if I can really be of any help.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001639" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001639">‘The greatest possible.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001640" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001640">‘Perhaps you would like me to stay there tonight.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001641" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001641">‘I was just going to propose it.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001642" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001642">‘Then if my friend of the night comes to revisit me, he will find the bird flown. We are all in your hands, Mr Holmes, and you must tell us exactly what you would like done. Perhaps you would prefer that Joseph came with us, so as to look after me?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001643" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001643">‘Oh, no; my friend Watson is a medical man, you know, and he’ll look after you. We’ll have our lunch here, if you will permit us, and then we shall all three set off for town together.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001644" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001644">It was arranged as he suggested, though Miss Harrison excused herself from leaving the bedroom, in accordance with Holmes’s suggestion. What the object of my friend’s manoeuvres was I could not conceive, unless it were to keep the lady away from Phelps, who, rejoiced by his returning health and by the prospect of action, lunched with us in the dining-room. Holmes had a still more startling surprise for us, however, for after accompanying us down to the station and seeing us into our carriage, he calmly announced that he had no intention of leaving Woking. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p269" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p269">‘There are one or two small points which I should desire to clear up before I go,’ said he. ‘Your absence, Mr Phelps, will in some ways rather assist me. Watson, when you reach London you would oblige me by driving at once to Baker Street with our friend here, and remaining with him until I see you again. It is fortunate that you are old schoolfellows, as you must have much to talk over. Mr Phelps can have the spare bedroom tonight, and I shall be with you in time for breakfast, for there is a train which will take me into Waterloo at eight.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001645" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001645">‘But how about our investigation in London?’ asked Phelps, ruefully.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001646" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001646">‘We can do that tomorrow. I think that just at present I can be of more immediate use here.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001647" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001647">‘You might tell them at Briarbrae that I hope to be back tomorrow night,’ cried Phelps, as we began to move from the platform.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001648" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001648">‘I hardly expect to go back to Briarbrae,’ answered Holmes, and waved his hand to us cheerily as we shot out from the station.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001649" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001649">Phelps and I talked it over on our journey, but neither of us could devise a satisfactory reason for this new development.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001650" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001650">‘I suppose he wants to find out some clue as to the burglary last night, if a burglar it was. For myself, I don’t believe it was an ordinary thief.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001651" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001651">‘What is your idea, then?’</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p270" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p270">‘Upon my word, you may put it down to my weak nerves or not, but I believe there is some deep political intrigue going on around me, and that, for some reason that passes my understanding, my life is aimed at by the conspirators. It sounds high-flown and absurd, but consider the facts! Why should a thief try to break in at a bedroom window, where there could be no hope of any plunder, and why should he come with a long knife in his hand?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001652" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001652">‘You are sure it was not a housebreaker’s jemmy?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001653" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001653">‘Oh, no; it was a knife. I saw the flash of the blade quite distinctly.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001654" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001654">‘But why on earth should you be pursued with such animosity?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001655" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001655">‘Ah! that is the question.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001656" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001656">‘Well, if Holmes takes the same view, that would account for his action, would it not? Presuming that your theory is correct, if he can lay his hands upon the man who threatened you last night, he will have gone a long way towards finding who took the naval treaty. It is absurd to suppose that you have two enemies, one of whom robs you while the other threatens your life.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001657" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001657">‘But Mr Holmes said that he was not going to Briarbrae.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001659" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001659">But it was a weary day for me. Phelps was still weak after his long illness, and his misfortunes made him querulous and nervous. In vain I endeavoured to interest him in Afghanistan, in India, in social questions, in anything which might take his mind out of the groove. He would always come back to his lost treaty; wondering, guessing, speculating, as to what Holmes was doing, what steps Lord Holdhurst was taking, what news we should have in the morning. As the evening wore on his excitement became quite painful. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001660" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001660">‘You have implicit faith in Holmes?’ he asked.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001666" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001666">‘He has said nothing.’</p>

It is when he is on a scent, and is not quite absolutely sure yet that it is the right one, that he is most taciturn. Now, my dear fellow, we can’t help matters by making ourselves nervous about them, so let me implore you to go to bed, and so be fresh for whatever may await us tomorrow.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001669" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001669">I was able at last to persuade my companion to take my advice, though I knew from his excited manner that there was not much hope of sleep for him. Indeed, his mood was infectious, for I lay tossing half the night myself, brooding over this strange problem, and inventing a hundred theories, each of which was more impossible than the last. Why had Holmes remained at Woking? Why had he asked Miss Harrison to stay in the sick-room all day? Why had he been so careful not to inform the people at Briarbrae that he intended to remain near them? I cudgelled my brains until I fell asleep in the endeavour to find some explanation which would cover all these facts. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001671" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001671">And my words were true, for shortly after eight a hansom dashed up to the door and our friend got out of it. Standing in the window, we saw that his left hand was swathed in a bandage and that his face was very grim and pale. He entered the house, but it was some little time before he came upstairs. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001672" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001672">‘He looks like a beaten man,’ cried Phelps.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001681" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001681">‘After breakfast, my dear Watson.

        <p id="chapter011-p273" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p273">The table was all laid, and, just as I was about to ring, Mrs Hudson entered with the tea and coffee. A few minutes later she brought in the covers, and we all drew up to the table, Holmes ravenous, I curious, and Phelps in the gloomiest state of depression. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001682" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001682">‘Mrs Hudson has risen to the occasion,’ said Holmes, uncovering a dish of curried chicken. ‘Her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotchwoman. What have you there, Watson?’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001683" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001683">‘Ham and eggs,’ I answered.</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001689" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001689">Phelps raised the cover, and as he did so he uttered a scream, and sat there staring with a face as white as the plate upon which he looked. Across the centre of it was lying a little cylinder of blue-grey paper. He caught it up, devoured it with his eyes, and then danced madly about the room, pressing it to his bosom and shrieking out in his delight. Then he fell back into an armchair, so limp and exhausted with his own emotions that we had to pour brandy down his throat to keep him from fainting. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001690" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001690">‘There! there!’ said Holmes, soothingly, patting him upon the shoulder. ‘It was too bad to spring it on you like this; but Watson here will tell you that I never can resist a touch of the dramatic.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001691" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001691">Phelps seized his hand and kissed it. ‘God bless you!’ he cried; ‘you have saved my honour.’</p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001695" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001695">‘I’ll tell you what I did first, and how I came to do it afterwards,’ said he. ‘After leaving you at the station I went for a charming walk through some admirable Surrey scenery to a pretty little village called Ripley, where I had my tea at an inn, and took the precaution of filling my flask and of putting a paper of sandwiches in my pocket. There I remained until evening, when I set off for Woking again and found myself in the high road outside Briarbrae just after sunset.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001696" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001696">‘Well, I waited until the road was clear – it is never a very frequented one at any time, I fancy – and then I clambered over the fence into the grounds.’ </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001698" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001698">‘Yes; but I have a peculiar taste in these matters. I chose the place where the three fir trees stand, and behind their screen I got over without the least chance of anyone in the house being able to see me. I crouched down among the bushes on the other side, and crawled from one to the other – witness the disreputable state of my trouser knees – until I had reached the clump of rhododendrons just opposite to your bedroom window. There I squatted down and awaited developments. </p>
        <p id="chapter011-p275" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p275">‘The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by the table.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001699" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001699">‘The key?’ ejaculated Phelps.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001700" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001700">‘Yes, I had given Miss Harrison instructions to lock the door on the outside and take the key with her when she went to bed. She carried out every one of my injunctions to the letter, and certainly without her co-operation you would not have that paper in your coat pocket. She departed then, the lights went out, and I was left squatting in the rhododendron bush. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001701" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001701">‘The night was fine, but still it was a very weary vigil. Of course, it has the sort of excitement about it that the sportsman feels when he lies beside the watercourse and waits for the big game. It was very long, though – almost as long, Watson, as when you and I waited in that deadly room when we looked into the little problem of the “Speckled Band”. There was a church clock down at Woking which struck the quarters, and I thought more than once that it had stopped. At last, however, about two in the morning, I suddenly heard the gentle sound of a bolt being pushed back, and the creaking of a key. A moment later the servants’ door was opened and Mr Joseph Harrison stepped out into the moonlight.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001702" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001702">‘Joseph!’ ejaculated Phelps.</p>

He walked on tiptoe under the shadow of the wall, and when he reached the window he worked a long-bladed knife through the sash and pushed back the catch. Then he flung open the window and, putting his knife through the crack in the shutters, he thrust the bar up and swung them open. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001703" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001703">‘From where I lay I had a perfect view of the inside of the room and of every one of his movements. He lit the two candles which stand upon the mantelpiece, and then he proceeded to turn back the corner of the carpet in the neighbourhood of the door. Presently he stooped and picked out a square piece of board, such as is usually left to enable plumbers to get at the joints of the gas pipes. This one covered, as a matter of fact, the T-joint which gives off the pipe which supplies the kitchen underneath. Out of this hiding-place he drew that little cylinder of paper, pushed down the board, rearranged the carpet, blew out the candles, and walked straight into my arms as I stood waiting for him outside the window. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001704" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001704">‘Well, he has rather more viciousness than I gave him credit for, has Master Joseph. He flew at me with his knife, and I had to grass him twice, and got a cut over the knuckles, before I had the upper hand of him. He looked “murder” out of the only eye he could see with when we had finished, but he listened to reason and gave up the papers. Having got them I let my man go, but I wired full particulars to Forbes this morning. If he is quick enough to catch his bird, well and good! But if, as I shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty before he gets there, why, all the better for the Government. I fancy that Lord Holdhurst, for one, and Mr Percy Phelps, for another, would very much rather that the affair never got so far as a police court.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001705" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001705">‘My God!’ gasped our client. ‘Do you tell me that during these long ten weeks of agony the stolen papers were within the very room with me all the time?’ </p>

I am afraid Joseph’s character is a rather deeper and more dangerous one than one might judge from his appearance. From what I have heard from him this morning, I gather that he has lost heavily in dabbling with stocks, and that he is ready to do anything on earth to better his fortunes. Being an absolutely selfish man, when a chance presented itself he did not allow either his sister’s happiness or your reputation to hold his hand.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001708" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001708">Percy Phelps sank back in his chair. ‘My head whirls,’ said he; ‘your words have dazed me.’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001709" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001709">‘The principal difficulty in your case,’ remarked Holmes, in his didactic fashion, ‘lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us, we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. I had already begun to suspect Joseph, from the fact that you had intended to travel home with him that night, and that therefore it was a likely enough thing that he should call for you – knowing the Foreign Office well – upon his way. When I heard that someone had been so anxious to get into the bedroom, in which no one but Joseph could have concealed anything – you told us in your narrative how you had turned Joseph out when you arrived with the doctor – my suspicions all changed to certainties, especially as the attempt was made on the first night upon which the nurse was absent, showing that the intruder was well acquainted with the ways of the house.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001710" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001710">‘How blind I have been!’</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p278" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p278">‘The facts of the case, as far as I have worked them out, are these: this Joseph Harrison entered the office through the Charles Street door, and knowing his way he walked straight into your room the instant after you left it. Finding no one there he promptly rang the bell, and at the instant that he did so his eyes caught the paper upon the table. A glance showed him that chance had put in his way a State document of immense value, and in a flash he had thrust it into his pocket and was gone. A few minutes elapsed, as you remember, before the sleepy commissionaire drew your attention to the bell, and those were just enough to give the thief time to make his escape. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001711" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001711">‘He made his way to Woking by the first train, and, having examined his booty and assured himself that it really was of immense value, he concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, with the intention of taking it out again in a day or two, and carrying it to the French Embassy, or wherever he thought that a long price was to be had. Then came your sudden return. He, without a moment’s warning, was bundled out of his room, and from that time onwards there were always at least two of you there to prevent him from regaining his treasure. The situation to him must have been a maddening one. But at last he thought he saw his chance. He tried to steal in, but was baffled by your wakefulness. You may remember that you did not take your usual draught that night.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001712" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001712">‘I remember.’</p>
        <p id="chapter011-p279" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter011-p279">‘I fancy that he had taken steps to make that draught efficacious, and that he quite relied upon your being unconscious. Of course, I understood that he would repeat the attempt whenever it could be done with safety. Your leaving the room gave him the chance he wanted. I kept Miss Harrison in it all day, so that he might not anticipate us. Then, having given him the idea that the coast was clear, I kept guard as I have described. I already knew that the papers were probably in the room, but I had no desire to rip up all the planking and skirting in search of them. I let him take them, therefore, from the hiding-place, and so saved myself an infinity of trouble. Is there any other point which I can make clear?’ </p>

In an incoherent and, as I deeply feel, an entirely inadequate fashion, I have endeavoured to give some account of my strange experiences in his company from the chance which first brought us together at the period of the ‘Study in Scarlet’, up to the time of his interference in the matter of the ‘Naval Treaty’ – an interference which had the unquestionable effect of preventing a serious international complication. It was my intention to have stopped there, and to have said nothing of that event which has created a void in my life which the lapse of two years has done little to fill. My hand has been forced, however, by the recent letters in which Colonel James Moriarty defends the memory of his brother, and I have no choice but to lay the facts before the public exactly as they occurred. I alone know the absolute truth of the matter, and I am satisfied that the time has come when no good purpose is to be served by its suppression. As far as I know, there have been only three accounts in the public Press: that in the </span><em id="em_000077" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#em_000077">Journal de Genève</em><span class="text" id="span_000115" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#span_000115"> upon May 6th, 1891, the Reuter’s despatch in the English papers upon May 7th, and finally the recent letters to which I have alluded. Of these the first and second were extremely condensed, while the last is, as I shall now show, an absolute perversion of the facts. It lies with me to tell for the first time what really took place between Professor Moriarty and Mr Sherlock Holmes. </span></p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001717" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001717">It may be remembered that after my marriage, and my subsequent start in private practice, the very intimate relations which had existed between Holmes and myself became to some extent modified. He still came to me from time to time when he desired a companion in his investigations, but these occasions grew more and more seldom, until I find that in the year 1890 there were only three cases of which I retain any record. During the winter of that year and the early spring of 1891, I saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the French Government upon a matter of supreme importance, and I received two notes from Holmes, dated from Narbonne and from Nîmes, from which I gathered that his stay in France was likely to be a long one. It was with some surprise, therefore, that I saw him walk into my consulting-room upon the evening of the 24th of April. It struck me that he was looking even paler and thinner than usual. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001718" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001718">‘Yes, I have been using myself up rather too freely,’ he remarked, in answer to my look rather than to my words; ‘I have been a little pressed of late.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001735" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001735">There was something very strange in all this.

That’s what puts him on a pinnacle in the records of crime. I tell you, Watson, in all seriousness, that if I could beat that man, if I could free society of him, I should feel that my own career had reached its summit, and I should be prepared to turn to some more placid line in life. Between ourselves, the recent cases in which I have been of assistance to the Royal Family of Scandinavia, and to the French Republic, have left me in such a position that I could continue to live in the quiet fashion which is most congenial to me, and to concentrate my attention upon my chemical researches. But I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001738" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001738">‘What has he done, then?’</p>
        <p id="chapter012-p285" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p285">‘His career has been an extraordinary one. He is a man of good birth and excellent education, endowed by Nature with a phenomenal mathematical faculty. At the age of twenty-one he wrote a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem, which has had a European vogue. On the strength of it, he won the Mathematical Chair at one of our smaller universities, and had, to all appearance, a most brilliant career before him. But the man had hereditary tendencies of the most diabolical kind. A criminal strain ran in his blood, which, instead of being modified, was increased and rendered infinitely more dangerous by his extraordinary mental powers. Dark rumours gathered round him in the university town, and eventually he was compelled to resign his Chair and to come down to London, where he set up as an Army coach. So much is known to the world, but what I am telling you now is what I have myself discovered. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001739" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001739">‘As you are aware, Watson, there is no one who knows the higher criminal world of London so well as I do. For years past I have continually been conscious of some power behind the malefactor, some deep organising power which for ever stands in the way of the law, and throws its shield over the wrong-doer. Again and again in cases of the most varying sorts – forgery cases, robberies, murders – I have felt the presence of this force, and I have deduced its action in many of those undiscovered crimes in which I have not been personally consulted. For years I have endeavoured to break through the veil which shrouded it, and at last the time came when I seized my thread and followed it, until it led me, after a thousand cunning windings, to ex-Professor Moriarty of mathematical celebrity. </p>
        <p id="chapter012-p286" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p286">‘He is the Napoleon of crime, Watson. He is the organiser of half that is evil and of nearly all that is undetected in this great city. He is a genius, a philosopher, an abstract thinker. He has a brain of the first order. He sits motionless, like a spider in the centre of its web, but that web has a thousand radiations, and he knows well every quiver of each of them. He does little himself. He only plans. But his agents are numerous and splendidly organised. Is there a crime to be done, a paper to be abstracted, we will say, a house to be rifled, a man to be removed – the word is passed to the professor, the matter is organised and carried out. The agent may be caught. In that case money is found for his bail or his defence. But the central power which uses the agent is never caught – never so much as suspected. This was the organisation which I deduced, Watson, and which I devoted my whole energy to exposing and breaking up. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001740" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001740">‘But the professor was fenced round with safeguards so cunningly devised that, do what I would, it seemed impossible to get evidence which could convict in a court of law. You know my powers, my dear Watson, and yet at the end of three months I was forced to confess that I had at last met an antagonist who was my intellectual equal. My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill. But at last he made a trip – only a little, little trip – but it was more than he could afford, when I was so close upon him. I had my chance, and, starting from that point, I have woven my net round him until now it is all ready to close. In three days, that is to say on Monday next, matters will be ripe, and the professor, with all the principal members of his gang, will be in the hands of the police. Then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over forty mysteries, and the rope for all of them – but if we move at all prematurely, you understand, they may slip out of our hands even at the last moment. </p>

But he was too wily for that. He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him. Again and again he strove to break away, but I as often headed him off. I tell you, my friend, that if a detailed account of that silent contest could be written, it would take its place as the most brilliant bit of thrust-and-parry work in the history of detection. Never have I risen to such a height, and never have I been so hard pressed by an opponent. He cut deep, and yet I just undercut him. This morning the last steps were taken, and three days only were wanted to complete the business. I was sitting in my room thinking the matter over, when the door opened and Professor Moriarty stood before me. </p>

His appearance was quite familiar to me. He is extremely tall and thin, his forehead domes out in a white curve, and his two eyes are deeply sunken in his head. He is clean-shaven, pale, and ascetic-looking, retaining something of the professor in his features. His shoulders are rounded from much study, and his face protrudes forward, and is for ever slowly oscillating from side to side in a curiously reptilian fashion. He peered at me with great curiosity in his puckered eyes. </p>

I went out about midday to transact some business in Oxford Street. As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the footpath and saved myself by a fraction of a second. The van dashed round from Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses and was shattered to fragments at my feet. I called the police and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled upon the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother’s rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I dare say, working out problems upon a blackboard ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door.’ </p>

It is obvious, therefore, that I cannot do better than get away for the few days which remain before the police are at liberty to act.

Now listen! You will despatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusty messenger unaddressed to Victoria tonight. In the morning you will send for a hansom, desiring your man to take neither the first nor the second which may present itself. Into this hansom you will jump, and you will drive to the Strand end of the Lowther Arcade, handing the address to the cabman upon a slip of paper, with a request that he will not throw it away. Have your fare ready, and the instant that your cab stops, dash through the Arcade, timing yourself to reach the other side at a quarter-past nine. You will find a small brougham waiting close to the kerb, driven by a fellow with a heavy black cloak tipped at the collar with red.

It was evident to me that he thought he might bring trouble to the roof he was under, and that that was the motive which impelled him to go. With a few hurried words as to our plans for the morrow he rose and came out with me into the garden, clambering over the wall which leads into Mortimer Street, and immediately whistling for a hansom, in which I heard him drive away. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001773" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001773">In the morning I obeyed Holmes’s injunctions to the letter. A hansom was procured with such precautions as would prevent its being one which was placed ready for us, and I drove immediately after breakfast to the Lowther Arcade, through which I hurried at the top of my speed. A brougham was waiting with a very massive driver wrapped in a dark cloak, who, the instant that I had stepped in, whipped up the horse and rattled off to Victoria Station. On my alighting there he turned the carriage, and dashed away without so much as a look in my direction. </p>

My luggage was waiting for me, and I had no difficulty in finding the carriage which Holmes had indicated, the less so as it was the only one in the train which was marked ‘Engaged’. My only source of anxiety now was the non-appearance of Holmes. The station clock marked only seven minutes from the time when we were due to start. In vain I searched among the groups of travellers and leave-takers for the lithe figure of my friend. There was no sign of him. I spent a few minutes in assisting a venerable Italian priest, who was endeavouring to make a porter understand, in his broken English, that his luggage was to be booked through to Paris. Then, having taken another look round, I returned to my carriage, where I found that the porter, in spite of the ticket, had given me my decrepit Italian friend as a travelling companion. It was useless for me to explain to him that his presence was an intrusion, for my Italian was even more limited than his English, so I shrugged my shoulders resignedly and continued to look out anxiously for my friend. A chill of fear had come over me, as I thought that his absence might mean that some blow had fallen during the night. Already the doors had all been shut and the whistle blown, when— </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001775" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001775">I turned in uncontrollable astonishment. The aged ecclesiastic had turned his face towards me. For an instant the wrinkles were smoothed away, the nose drew away from the chin, the lower lip ceased to protrude and the mouth to mumble, the dull eyes regained their fire, the drooping figure expanded. The next the whole frame collapsed, and Holmes had gone as quickly as he had come. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001776" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001776">‘Good heavens!’ I cried. ‘How you startled me!’</p>

It was evident, however, that Holmes understood the situation more clearly than I did. At Canterbury, therefore, we alighted, only to find that we should have to wait an hour before we could get a train to Newhaven. </p>

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001811" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001811">We made our way to Brussels that night and spent two days there, moving on upon the third day as far as Strasbourg. On the Monday morning Holmes had telegraphed to the London police, and in the evening we found a reply waiting for us at our hotel.

        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001817" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001817">For a charming week we wandered up the Valley of the Rhône, and then, branching off at Leuk, we made our way over the Gemmi Pass, still deep in snow, and so, by way of Interlaken, to Meiringen. It was a lovely trip, the dainty green of the spring below, the virgin white of the winter above; but it was clear to me that never for one instant did Holmes forget the shadow which lay across him. In the homely Alpine villages or in the lonely mountain passes, I could still tell, by his quick glancing eyes and his sharp scrutiny of every face that passed us, that he was well convinced that, walk where we would, we could not walk ourselves clear of the danger which was dogging our footsteps. </p>
        <p id="chapter012-p298" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p298">Once, I remember, as we passed over the Gemmi, and walked along the border of the melancholy Daubensee, a large rock which had been dislodged from the ridge upon our right clattered down and roared into the lake behind us. In an instant Holmes had raced up on to the ridge, and, standing upon a lofty pinnacle, craned his neck in every direction. It was in vain that our guide assured him that a fall of stones was a common chance in the springtime at that spot. He said nothing, but he smiled at me with the air of a man who sees the fulfilment of that which he had expected. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001818" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001818">And yet for all his watchfulness he was never depressed. On the contrary, I can never recollect having seen him in such exuberant spirits. Again and again he recurred to the fact that if he could be assured that society was freed from Professor Moriarty, he would cheerfully bring his own career to a conclusion. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001819" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001819">‘I think that I may go so far as to say, Watson, that I have not lived wholly in vain,’ he remarked. ‘If my record were closed tonight I could still survey it with equanimity. The air of London is the sweeter for my presence. In over a thousand cases I am not aware that I have ever used my powers upon the wrong side. Of late I have been tempted to look into the problems furnished by Nature rather than those more superficial ones for which our artificial state of society is responsible. Your memoirs will draw to an end, Watson, upon the day that I crown my career by the capture or extinction of the most dangerous and capable criminal in Europe.’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001820" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001820">I shall be brief, and yet exact, in the little which remains for me to tell. It is not a subject on which I would willingly dwell, and yet I am conscious that a duty devolves upon me to omit no detail. </p>
        <p id="chapter012-p299" xml:space="preserve"><span class="text" id="span_000122" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#span_000122">It was upon the 3rd of May that we reached the little village of Meiringen, where we put up at the Englischer Hof, then kept by Peter Steiler the elder. Our landlord was an intelligent man, and spoke excellent English, having served for three years as waiter at the Grosvenor Hotel in London. At his advice, upon the afternoon of the 4th we set off together with the intention of crossing the hills and spending the night at the hamlet of Rosenlaui. We had strict injunctions, however, on no account to pass the falls of Reichenbach, which are about half-way up the hill, without making a small </span><em id="em_000081" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#em_000081">détour</em><span class="text" id="span_000123" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#span_000123"> to see them. </span></p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001821" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001821">It is, indeed, a fearful place. The torrent, swollen by the melting snow, plunges into a tremendous abyss, from which the spray rolls up like the smoke from a burning house. The shaft into which the river hurls itself is an immense chasm, lined by glistening, coal-black rock, and narrowing into a creaming, boiling pit of incalculable depth, which brims over and shoots the stream onward over its jagged lip. The long sweep of green water roaring for ever down, and the thick flickering curtain of spray hissing for ever upwards, turn a man giddy with their constant whirl and clamour. We stood near the edge peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against the black rocks, and listening to the half-human shout which came booming up with the spray out of the abyss. </p>
        <p id="chapter012-p300" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p300">The path has been cut half-way round the fall to afford a complete view, but it ends abruptly, and the traveller has to return as he came. We had turned to do so, when we saw a Swiss lad come running along it with a letter in his hand. It bore the mark of the hotel which we had just left, and was addressed to me by the landlord. It appeared that within a very few minutes of our leaving, an English lady had arrived who was in the last stage of consumption. She had wintered at Davos Platz, and was journeying now to join her friends at Lucerne, when a sudden haemorrhage had overtaken her. It was thought that she could hardly live a few hours, but it would be a great consolation to her to see an English doctor, and, if I would only return, etc., etc. The good Steiler assured me in a postscript that he would himself look upon my compliance as a great favour, since the lady absolutely refused to see a Swiss physician, and he could not but feel that he was incurring a great responsibility. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001822" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001822">The appeal was one which could not be ignored. It was impossible to refuse the request of a fellow-countrywoman dying in a strange land. Yet I had my scruples about leaving Holmes. It was finally agreed, however, that he should retain the young Swiss messenger with him as guide and companion while I returned to Meiringen. My friend would stay some little time at the fall, he said, and would then walk slowly over the hill to Rosenlaui, where I was to rejoin him in the evening. As I turned away I saw Holmes with his back against a rock and his arms folded, gazing down at the rush of waters. It was the last that I was ever destined to see of him in this world. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001823" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001823">When I was near the bottom of the descent I looked back. It was impossible, from that position, to see the fall, but I could see the curving path which winds over the shoulder of the hill and leads to it. Along this a man was, I remember, walking very rapidly. I could see his black figure clearly outlined against the green behind him. I noted him, and the energy with which he walked, but he passed from my mind again as I hurried on upon my errand. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001824" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001824">It may have been a little over an hour before I reached Meiringen. Old Steiler was standing at the porch of his hotel.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001825" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001825">‘Well,’ said I, as I came hurrying up, ‘I trust that she is no worse?’</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001826" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001826">A look of surprise passed over his face, and at the first quiver of his eyebrows my heart turned to lead in my breast.</p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001827" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001827">‘You did not write this?’ I said, pulling the letter from my pocket. ‘There is no sick Englishwoman in the hotel?’</p>
        <p id="chapter012-p301" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p301">‘Certainly not,’ he cried. ‘But it has the hotel mark upon it! Ha! it must have been written by that tall Englishman who came in after you had gone. He said—’ </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001828" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001828">But I waited for none of the landlord’s explanations. In a tingle of fear I was already running down the village street, and making for the path which I had so lately descended. It had taken me an hour to come down. For all my efforts, two more had passed before I found myself at the fall of the Reichenbach once more. There was Holmes’s alpenstock still leaning against the rock by which I had left him. But there was no sign of him, and it was in vain that I shouted. My only answer was my own voice reverberating in a rolling echo from the cliffs around me. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001829" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001829">It was the sight of that alpenstock which turned me cold and sick. He had not gone to Rosenlaui, then. He had remained on that three-foot path, with sheer wall on one side and sheer drop on the other, until his enemy had overtaken him. The young Swiss had gone too. He had probably been in the pay of Moriarty, and had left the two men together. And then what had happened? Who was to tell us what had happened then? </p>
        <p id="chapter012-p302" xml:space="preserve" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#chapter012-p302">I stood for a minute or two to collect myself, for I was dazed with the horror of the thing. Then I began to think of Holmes’s own methods and to try to practise them in reading this tragedy. It was, alas, only too easy to do! During our conversation we had not gone to the end of the path, and the alpenstock marked the place where we had stood. The blackish soil is kept for ever soft by the incessant drift of the spray, and a bird would leave its tread upon it. Two lines of footmarks were clearly marked along the farther end of the path, both leading away from me. There were none returning. A few yards from the end the soil was all ploughed up into a patch of mud, and the brambles and ferns which fringed the chasm were torn and bedraggled. I lay upon my face and peered over, with the spray spouting up all around me. It had darkened since I had left, and now I could only see here and there the glistening of moisture upon the black walls, and far away down at the end of the shaft the gleam of the broken water. I shouted; but only that same half-human cry of the fall was borne back to my ears. </p>
        <p xml:space="preserve" id="p_001830" smilref="Sherlock_Holmes__The_Memoirs00005.smil#p_001830">But it was destined that I should after all have a last word of greeting from my friend and comrade. I have said that his alpenstock had been left leaning against a rock which jutted on to the path. From the top of this boulder the gleam of something bright caught my eye, and, raising my hand, I found that it came from the silver cigarette-case which he used to carry. As I took it up a small square of paper upon which it had lain fluttered down on to the ground. Unfolding it I found that it consisted of three pages torn from his notebook and addressed to me. It was characteristic of the man that the direction was as precise, and the writing as firm and clear, as though it had been written in his study. </p>

I have already explained to you, however, that my career had in any case reached its crisis, and that no possible conclusion to it could be more congenial to me than this. Indeed, if I may make a full confession to you, I was quite convinced that the letter from Meiringen was a hoax, and I allowed you to depart on that errand under the persuasion that some development of this sort would follow. Tell Inspector Patterson that the papers which he needs to convict the gang are in pigeon-hole M, done up in a blue envelope and inscribed ‘Moriarty’.

An examination by experts leaves little doubt that a personal contest between the two men ended, as it could hardly fail to end in such a situation, in their reeling over, locked in each other’s arms. Any attempt at recovering the bodies was absolutely hopeless, and there, deep down in that dreadful cauldron of swirling water and seething foam, will lie for all time the most dangerous criminal and the foremost champion of the law of their generation. The Swiss youth was never found again, and there can be no doubt that he was one of the numerous agents whom Moriarty kept in his employ. As to the gang, it will be within the memory of the public how completely the evidence which Holmes had accumulated exposed their organisation, and how heavily the hand of the dead man weighed upon them. Of their terrible chief few details came out during the proceedings, and if I have now been compelled to make a clear statement of his career, it is due to those injudicious champions who have endeavoured to clear his memory by attacks upon him whom I shall ever regard as the best and the wisest man whom I have ever known. </p>
