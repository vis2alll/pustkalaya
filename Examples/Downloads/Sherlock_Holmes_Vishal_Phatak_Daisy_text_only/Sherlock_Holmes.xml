There is one last frightening member of the estate: Mr. Rucastle’s ferocious mastiff, who is kept under lock and key during the day. At night the beast is let loose on the grounds to patrol for trespassers. Rucastle admits that the dog is so wild he can’t tame him—only Toller is able to handle the creature.</span></p>

John Straker and his wife live nearby, and their maid took Hunter’s dinner out to him—a curried mutton, to be precise.

Someone inside the Straker household must have planned to serve curry that evening, in order to fit into a larger scheme. That person was John Straker: He drugged the boy so that he could sneak the horse out of its stable, out on the moor. Why didn’t the dog bark and wake up the other lads sleeping in the loft?
